    * Yes, controllers in Spring-MVC are singletons. Between multiple requests your class variable get shared and might 
      result into ambiguity. You can use @Scope("request") annotation above your controller to avoid such ambiguity.

# Spring Container
  * it is known as Application Context
  * IOC
  * DI     
  
# Inversion Of Control(IOC) (Object Creation Factory)
  * Object creation, Object management
  * objects ready with all dependencies
  * DI via interface is highly preferred thank Concrete Classes(using the class it self directly)
    * Allows runtime to decide implementation to inject
    * follows interface Segregation principle of SOLID
    * Also makes code testable

# Dependency Injection(auto wiring)
  * objects with dependencies requirements will be injected using DI. If a class needs a service it will be injected 
  * Types: 
    * Constructor Injection
    * Setter Injection    
    * Property Injection

# Bean xml configuration => spring-demo-one
  * need to create .xml files and create beans there
  * no annotation for auto wiring, hence pass it via constructor-arg or property value for beans
     * for this type to work need do 
       * //load spring configuration
         ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context = 
                new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
         Coach theCoach = context.getBean("myCoach", Coach.class);       
         		
     * <bean id="myCricketCoach" scope="singleton"
          		  class="com.luv2code.springdemo.CricketCoach">
          		  <!-- set up setter injection -->
          		  <property name="fortuneService" ref="myFortuneService" />
          		  <!-- set literal values -->
          		  <!-- <property name="emailAddress" value="thebestcoach@luv2code.com" />
          		  <property name="team" value="Royal Challengers Bangalore" /> -->
          		  <constructor-arg ref="myFortuneService" />
          		  <property name="emailAddress" value="${foo.email}" />
          		  <property name="team" value="${foo.team}" />    		  
           </bean> 
           
     * this is equal to for constructor-arg => CricketCoach myCricketCoach = new CricketCoach(myFortuneService)
     * property => myCricketCoach.setEmailAddress('thebestcoach@luv2code.com')
     * property is the class variables and constructor-arg, these are DI instead of using auto wiring 
       *  property => using setter method injection
     * Attaching string literals, ${foo.email}
       * in .xml file add =>  <context:property-placeholder location="classpath:sport.properties"/>  
       

# Bean Scope 
  - https://www.baeldung.com/spring-bean-scopes, 
  - https://www.journaldev.com/21039/spring-bean-scopes,
  - https://grokonez.com/spring-framework/spring-bean-scope-annotation-requestscope-sessionscope-applicationscope
  
  * Singleton Scope
    - Default is singleton 
    - only one instance of the bean is created and the same instance will be shared with all other's. It will be cached 
    - Be careful of making static variables and final variables, it will lead to race condition. Synchronisation needs to be applied which costs in performance      
  * Prototype Scope
    - new instance will be created every time
  * Request Scope
    - Scoped to an HTTP Web Request. Only Used for web apps
    - A single instance per http request, only valid in the context of web-aware Spring Application-Context
  * Session scope
    - Scoped to an HTTP Web Session. Only Used for web apps 
    - A Single instance per http session, only valid in the context of web-aware Spring Application-Context    
  * global-session
    - Scoped to an Global HTTP Web Session. Only Used for web apps 
    - A single Instance per Global Session. Typically used in a portlet Context. only valid in the context of web-aware Spring Application-Context     
    - Not Used Much, legacy code.
  * Application
    - bean is scoped to the lifecycle of Servlet Context. only valid in the context of web-aware 
  * WebSocket
    - Scopes a Single Bean definition to the lifecycle of a WebSocket. Only Valid in the Context of web-aware Spring Application-Context 
  * Custom Scope 
    - Spring Scopes are Extensible, and we can define our own Scope by implementing spring's 'Scope' Interface
    
  * Note
    - We cannot override the built in singleton and prototype scopes    
    
# Bean Life Cycles
  *  XML:
       * <bean id="myCoach" 
            		  class="com.luv2code.springdemo.TrackCoach"
            		  init-method="doMyStartupStuff"
            		  destroy-method="doMyCleanUpStuff">
            		  <!-- setup constructor injection -->
            		  <constructor-arg ref="myFortuneService" />
             </bean>     
  * For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the destroy method.  Gasp!  
  * In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a prototype bean: the container 
    instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a prototype object, and hands it to the client, with no further 
    record of that prototype instance.  
  * Thus, although initialization lifecycle callback methods are called on all objects regardless of scope, in the case 
    of prototypes, configured destruction lifecycle callbacks are not called. The client code must clean up prototype-scoped 
    objects and release expensive resources that the prototype bean(s) are holding.

      * Shutdown  
        - Container ShutDown -> Disposable Bean's destroy() -> Call Custom Destroy Method  
    
    * CallBack Interfaces
      * spring has two interfaces you can implement for call back events
        - IntializingBean.afterPropertiesSet() => called after properties are set
        - DisposableBean.destroy() => called during bean destruction
        
    * Bean LifeCycle Annotations
      * @PostConstruct 
        * will be called after the bean has been constructed, but before its returned to the requesting object
        
      * @PreDestroy    
        * is called just before the bean is destroyed  
        
    * Bean PostProcessors
      * Gives us a means to tap into the Spring COntext life cycle and interact with the beans as they are processed
      
      * postProcessBeforeInitialization 
        * called before bean initialization method
      
      * postProcessAfterInitialization
        * called after bean initialization

# Beans => Java Annotations(IOC using annotation) (spring-demo-annotation)
  * Annotations are meta data of class(like labels on shoe box describing the content color, size, make)
  * Component Scan, will scan java application for annotation(@Bean, @service, etc) and register the beans in the Spring Container(Application Context)            
  * To enable component scanning in XML configuration
     * <context:component-scan base-package="com.luv2code.springdemo"></context:component-scan> 
     
# Spring Configuration with Java Annotations & DI

  * DI via interface is highly preferred than Concrete Classes(using the class it self directly)
    * Allows runtime to decide implementation to inject
    * follows interface Segregation principle of SOLID
    * Also makes code testable
    
    
  * Autowiring/Injections 
    * Constructor Injection
     -  public class TennisCoach {
          private FortuneService fortuneService;
          //constructor injection
            @Autowired 
          	public void TennisCoach(FortuneService theFortuneService) {
          		fortuneService = theFortuneService;
          	}
        }
     - As of Spring Framework 4.3, an @Autowired annotation on such a constructor is no longer necessary if the target 
       bean only defines one constructor to begin with. However, if several constructors are available, at least one 
       must be annotated to teach the container which one to use.  
        	
    * Setter Injection or as normal method
     -  public class TennisCoach {
            private FortuneService fortuneService;
            // constructor
            public void TennisCoach() {}
           
              @Autowired   //as setter
              public void setFortuneService(FortuneService theFortuneService) {
            		fortuneService = theFortuneService;
              }
              
              //    @Autowired // as normal method
              //	public void initFortuneService(FortuneService theFortuneService) {
              //		System.out.println("autowiring the service");
              //		fortuneService = theFortuneService;
              //	} 
            
         }
       
    * Field Injection => Accomplished using Java Reflections
      -  public class TennisCoach {
              @Autowired
              private FortuneService fortuneService;
              // constructor
              public void TennisCoach() {}   
          }
          
    * Which One to use
      - Constructor Injection is most preffered  
      - Any one can be used, as stated in spring doc it is consistance in performance
    
    * Qualifiers for DI (multiple implementation of an interface and being injected)
      * By default it will not inject any implementation, will throw error 
        "Error creating Bean name 'name of bean Injection of autowired dependincies failed"
        " NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException" 
      * @Qualifier('servicename-name, beanid of class in samll')
      
      * Constructor Based
        -   @Autowired
            public TennisCoach(@Qualifier("randomFortuneService") FortuneService theFortuneService) {
        
                System.out.println(">> TennisCoach: inside constructor using @autowired and @qualifier");
                
                fortuneService = theFortuneService;
            }  
      
      * Filed Injection
        - @Qualifier("randomFortuneService") // when multiple implementations of interface is there to specify specific one
          	private FortuneService fortuneService;  
          	
      * Important Note
         * Annotations - Default Bean Names ... and the Special Case
           
           In general, when using Annotations, for the default bean name, Spring uses the following rule.
           
           If the annotation's value dosen't indicate a bean name, an appropriate name will be built based on the short name of the class (with the first letter lower-cased).
           
           For example:
           
           HappyFortuneService --> happyFortuneService
           
           ---
           
           However, for the special case of when BOTH the first and second characters of the class name are upper case, then the name is NOT converted.
           
           For the case of RESTFortuneService
           
           RESTFortuneService --> RESTFortuneService
           
           No conversion since the first two characters are upper case.
           
           Behind the scenes, Spring uses the Java Beans Introspector to generate the default bean name. Here's a screenshot of the documentation for the key method.    	     

         As always, you can give explicity names to your beans.
         
         @Component("foo")
         public class RESTFortuneService .... {
             
         }
       
        * When Spring creates the beans it follows this general process
          (https://www.udemy.com/spring-hibernate-tutorial/learn/v4/t/lecture/5385040?start=0)
          1. Construct an instance of class
          2. Inject dependencies
          3. Set properties etc (@Value) 
          
# Primary Annotation for Spring Beans(@Primary) => di-demo(Jhon)
  *  When there multiple beans of the same type which all implement the same interface, we can use this to choose which 
     one by default to be selected
     
  -  @Service
     @Primary // making it default if more beans of same impl, without others having an @primary mentioned
     //@Profile({"en", "default"})
     // making one profile as default, when more @Primary are there => wrong
     public class PrimaryGreetingService implements GreetingService {
     
         private GreetingRepository greetingRepository;
     
         public PrimaryGreetingService(GreetingRepository greetingRepository) {
             this.greetingRepository = greetingRepository;
        }
     }     
     
# Profiles
  * Profiles are used to set at runtime which configures spring how it wires up things
  * when run with profiles spring brings all beans marked with that profile
  - @Service
    //@Primary // making it default if more beans of same impl, without others having an @primary mentioned
    @Profile({"en", "default"}) // multiple profiles it can support
    // making one profile as default, when more @Primary are there
    public class PrimaryGreetingService implements GreetingService {
    
       private GreetingRepository greetingRepository;
    
       public PrimaryGreetingService(GreetingRepository greetingRepository) {
           this.greetingRepository = greetingRepository;
      }
    }              
     
  * Default profiles 
    * there is default profile available by default when no other profiles are active, and springboot at run time will use that.
    * we can set a profile as default as below
    - @Profile({"en", "default"}) 
      - if 'en' is te as active profile use it, or else this will be default profile
      - example set dev env as default profile.
        - @Profile({"dev", "default"})
           
# Bean Scopes With Anotations(@Scope)
    * @Scope("prototype") //"singleton" is default
      public class TennisCoach {
         @Autowired
         private FortuneService fortuneService;
         // constructor
         public void TennisCoach() {}   
      }
    * https://www.boraji.com/spring-singleton-scope-example-using-scope-annotation
    
# Bean Life Cycle with Annotations
  * // bean life cycle pre and post calls
    // init method
    @PostConstruct
    public void doMyStartUpStuff() {
        System.out.println("Init tennis init bean");
    }
    
    @PreDestroy
    public void doMyCleanUpStuff() {
        System.out.println("Destroy tennis destroy bean");
    }
  
  * Access modifier
    
    The method can have any access modifier (public, protected, private)
    
    Return type
    The method can have any return type. However, "void' is most commonly used. If you give a return type just note that
    you will not be able to capture the return value. As a result, "void" is commonly used.
    
    Method name
    The method can have any method name.
    
    Arguments
    The method can not accept any arguments. The method should be no-arg.  
    
# Configuring Spring Container using Java Code
  * in properties file
   * api.host=localhost
   * ane.authentication.url=https://${ane.host}/login/AuthenticationCheck?tok= 
  * create a java class and annotate as @Configuration
  * Add component Scanning support: @ComponentScan
  * Read Spring Java Configuration class
  * Retrive bean from Spring Container
  - //sportConfig.java
    @Configuration
    @ComponentScan("com.luv2code.springdemo") // it scans all @component in package and intializes
    @PropertySource("classpath:sport.properties") // this also gets loaded into spring context like bean and can be accessed using @Value("${foo.email}")
    public class SportConfig {
    
        // inject dependency, define bean 
        @Bean
        public FortuneService sadFortuneService() {
            return new SadFortuneService();
        }
        
        // define method to expose bean, method name is bean ID and inject
        @Bean
        public Coach swimCoach() {
            return new SwimCoach(sadFortuneService());
        }
    	
    }
    - AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = 
      				new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SportConfig.class);
      Coach theCoach = context.getBean("tennisCoach", Coach.class);
      
    -   @Bean
        public FortuneService sadFortuneService() {
            return new SadFortuneService();
        }
        
        * This approach is taken if the class does not have stereotype annotation defined(@Component, @Service etc.), in
          this case beans won't be created hence we need to manually add them like we do in XML, and this is the approach.
          The classes with the annotation will be created and added into the spring container. 
          
    - Inject Values from properties file:
      * @PropertySource("classpath:sport.properties") 
      * in the class that uses these values
        - public class SwimCoach implements Coach {
          	
          	private FortuneService fortuneService;
          	
          	@Value("${foo.email}")
          	private String email;
          	    
          	@Value("${foo.team}")
          	private String team;
          	
          	public SwimCoach(FortuneService theFortuneService) {
          		fortuneService = theFortuneService;
          	}
        } 
    
    - External Properties (section 6, jhon)

# Spring MVC Configuration without Spring Boot => (99/100/102 chad)
  * Add Configurations to file WEB-INF/web.xml
    - Configure Spring MVC Dispatcher Servlet
    - Setup URL mappings to Spring MVC Dispatcher Servlet
  * Add Configurations to file WEB-INF/spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml
    - Add support for Spring Component Scanning 
    - Add Support for conversion, formatting and validation
    - Configure Spring MVC View Resolver     
    
    
# Controller
  * @RestController(with response body for rest) or @Controller 
  * @RequestMapping for url mapping which is general, need to mention get, put, delete, post
  * @GetMapping, @PostMapping
    
  - Get Parameters for controller
    - using httpServlet request
    - public String letsShoutDude(HttpServletRequest request, Model model) {
      		String theName = request.getParameter("studentName");
      		
      		theName = theName.toUpperCase();
      		
      		String result = "Yo! " +  theName;
      		model.addAttribute("message", result);
      		
      		return "helloworld";
      		
      	}
    - Using @RequestParam => use to bind the incoming parameter
      * http://appsdeveloperblog.com/requestparam-spring-mvc/
      * methodName(@RequestParam("paramName") String theName)  => api/v1/index?page=1
      * public String processFormVersionThree(@RequestParam("studentName") String theName, Model model) {
        		
        		theName = theName.toUpperCase();
        		
        		String result = "Hey v3! " +  theName;
        		model.addAttribute("message", result);
        		
        		return "helloworld";
        		
        	}
     
    -  @RequestBody => maps the request body json to class defined in spring
      * https://www.baeldung.com/spring-request-response-body
      * public OperationStatusModel requestReset(@RequestBody PasswordResetRequestModel passwordResetRequestModel) {} 
      
    - @PathVariable => used to get the dynamic id from the url  
      * @GetMapping("recipe/{id}/update")
        public String updateRecipe(@PathVariable String id, Model model){
               
        }
      * Using model here is like instance varaibles in rails, so that the can be accessed in templates 
    
    * @InitBinder(chad)    
      - add in the controller
        -  @InitBinder
           	public void initBinder(WebDataBinder dataBinder) {
           		StringTrimmerEditor stringTrimmerEditor = new StringTrimmerEditor(true);
           		dataBinder.registerCustomEditor(String.class, stringTrimmerEditor);
           	}
        
      - // add an initbinder ... to convert the trim input strings
        // remove leading and trailing white spaces
        // resolve issue for our validation   	
        
# Validations
  * https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-declaring-bean-constraints
  * Adding validation to DTO is ideal
  * Validation Rest Controller:

    * https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-bean-validation
    * the BindingResult parameter must immediately after the model attribute.
      -  @RequestMapping("/processForm")
         public String processForm(
                 @Valid @ModelAttribute("customer") Customer theCustomer,
                 BindingResult theBindingResult) {
                         
         } 
    * @InitBinder
      Validating space, it gets skipped in validation to overcome use this
      - Add preprocessing code with @InitBinder  
      - It preprocesses each web request   
  
  * Regular Expressions Validations
    - @Pattern(regexp="^[a-zA-Z0-9]{5}", message="must have 5 chars")
      	private String postalCode; 
  
  * Custom Error messages chad(157)
  
  * Custom Validation => Custom Java Annotation => spring-Mvc-Demo
    * in entity class
      -   @CourseCode(value="TOPS", message="must start with TOPS")
        //@CourseCode
          private String courseCode;
    * Create an Interface 
      - @Constraint(validatedBy = CourseCodeConstraintValidator.class)
        @Target({ ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD })
        @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
        public @interface CourseCode {
        	//define default course code
        	public String value() default "LUV";
        	
        	// define default error message
        	public String message() default "must start with LUV";
        	
        	//define default groups
        	public Class<?>[] groups() default {};
        	
        	//define default payloads
        	public Class<? extends Payload>[] payload() default {};		
        }
     
    * Need to implement ConstraintValidator  
      - public class CourseCodeConstraintValidator 
        			implements ConstraintValidator<CourseCode, String> {
        	
        	private String coursePrefix;
        	
        	@Override
        	public void initialize(CourseCode theCourseCode) {
        		//theCourseCode is default value given "LUV"
        		coursePrefix = theCourseCode.value();
        	}
        	
        	@Override
        	public boolean isValid(String theCode, ConstraintValidatorContext theConstraintValidatorContext) {
        		// theCode is value entered on html form
        		boolean result;
        				
        		if(theCode != null) {
        			result = theCode.startsWith(coursePrefix);
        		}
        		else {
        			result = true;
        		}
        		return result;
        	}

    * http://www.makeinjava.com/logging-aspect-restful-web-service-using-spring-aop-log-requests-responses/
    
  * Frameworks
    * Spring AOP (implements Aop)
      * runtime weaving
      * Uses AOP in background for Security, Caching, transactions etc
      * Using Proxy pattern
      * only applicable to method-level
      * can migrate to Aspectj when using @Aspect annotation
      * Can only apply aspects to beans created by spring app context
      * minor performance cost for aspect execution(run time weaving)
      * Spring AOP is a light weight implementation of AOP
      * Solves common problems in enterprise applications
      
    * Aspectj  (see 316 chad for good reference books)
      * Provides complete support for AOP
      * Rich Support for join point => method-level, Constructor, field
      * compile-time weaving, post compile time weaving and run time
      * supports all join points
      * works on any pojo not just beans from app context
      * Faster performance
      * compiler time weaving requires extra compilation step
      * AspectJ pointCut syntax can become complex 
    
    - Declaring an AOP in Spring App, in Config file
      @Configuration // for pure java configuration 
      @EnableAspectJAutoProxy
      @ComponentScan("com.lu2code.aopdemo")
      public class DemoConfig {
          //	@Bean
          //	public AccountDAO accountDAO() {
          //		return new AccountDAO();
          //	}
      }

    - Creating an AOP
      @Aspect
      @Component
      public class MyDemoLoggingAspect {
      }  
      
  
  * Like spying on the requests  
  * Terminologies
    * Aspect
      * module of code for cross cutting concern(logic => logging, security)
      - public void beforeAddAccountAdvice() {
         System.out.println("\n=====>>> Executing @Before advice on addAccount()");    
      }	
      
    * Advice 
      * what action is taken and when it should be applied
        * Before, After returning, After Throwing, After Finally, Around
             
    * Join Point
      * when to apply code during program execution
      * Read Method arguments/parameters
      * Display method Signature
      * Gives info about method it is executing
      -  @Before("com.lu2code.aopdemo.aspect.LuvAopExpressions.forDaoPackageNoGetterSetter()") // any modifier ,return type, package name, any class, any method
         	public void beforeAddAccountAdvice(JoinPoint theJoinPoint) {	
         		myLogger.info("\n=====>>> Executing @Before advice on addAccount()");	
         		
         		// display the method signature
         		MethodSignature methodSig = (MethodSignature) theJoinPoint.getSignature();
         		myLogger.info("\nMethod SIgnature: " + methodSig);
         		
         		// display method arguments
         		
         		Object[] args = theJoinPoint.getArgs();
         		
         		for(Object tempArg : args) {
         			myLogger.info(tempArg.toString());

         			}
         		}
         	}  
      
    * PointCut Expressions
      * A predicate expression for where advice should be applied
      * can be directly mentioned in the advices or by can be done as re-useable and apply to multiple expression  
        * Pointcut Expression Language
          - execution(modifiers-pattern? return-type-pattern declaring-type-pattern(classname)? method-name-pattern(param-pattern) throws-pattern?)
          - "execution(public void com.luv2code.AccountDAO.addAccount())"
        * Re-useable PointCut Expressions
          - @Aspect
            public class LuvAopExpressions {
            	//#### point cut declarations ### for reusability

            	public void forDaoPackage() {}

            	// match getter methods

                }	
            } 
  
    * AOP Ordering
        * Control the order of advices being applied
        * manage order when same conditions are met, i.e when multiple advices are targeted for same methods the order to
          follow
        * when order value for the aspects is same spring takes care of it randomly
          
        - @Aspect

  * Weaving
    * connecting aspects to target objects to create an advised object

      * Load time weaving(run time)
        * this is the slowest

# Custom Exception Handling in Spring Boot => spring-rest-demo

  *  define a exception class first implementing runtime exception
    -  public class StudentNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
       
            public StudentNotFoundException(String message, Throwable cause) {
                super(message, cause);

            public StudentNotFoundException(String message) {
                super(message);
                
            }
           
            public StudentNotFoundException(Throwable cause) {
                super(cause);
            
            }
       }

  * Now Add a exception handler
      *  @ControllerAdvice
         * for global exception handling use the @ControllerAdvice, it is similar to interceptor/filter

    * Repository (Base)
      @Repository: This is also a spring-framework's annotation. When you annotate a class @Repository, 
      spring container understands it's a DAO class and translates all unchecked exceptions (thrown from DAO methods) 
      into Spring DataAccessException. DAO class is the class where you write methods to perform operations over db.

    # Hibernates default persistence strategy for inheritance
      * Single Table Inheritance -> leads to lot of unused colomns, with type colomn as common  
      * Hibernates ddl-auto property control's if any ddl operatiions hibernate will perform on start up.
        * options for ddl-auto => 
          - none, 
          - validate(used for production to check if any attribute or table is missed), 
          - update, 
          - create, 
          - create-drop() using embeded DB
  
  # Spring Data
    * removes the old way of configuring and boiler plate code      
    * Intially we used to do and write all the logic in DaoImpl
      - EmployeeDao -> EmployeeDaoImpl -> EntityManager(mapping) -> DriverManagerSource(DBConnection)

    * Types
      * GenerationType.AUTO
        * Persistence Provider like hibernate has to check the underlying DB which kind of PK ID generation Strategy 
          does it support. It can be either one of IDENTITY or SEQUENCE or TABLE
           
      * GenerationType.IDENTITY
        * Persistence Provider will rely on the PK auto-increment and db should also be configured to it.
      
      * GenerationType.SEQUENCE (Sequence => create custom value to generate the PK like ORACLE)
        * Need to tell the Persistence Provider which sequence to use
      
      * GenerationType.TABLE
        * A special table is used, the Persistence Provider will generate a value and put it in this table as a column
          and use that column as PK in the actual table we use
        * whene creating a new record, it will generate a new value base on the special table and put in the actual table  
        * idgenerators project has an example of this
      
      -  @Id
         @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)

          * Card
          * Check
          
    * SINGLE_TABLE(STI)
      * Need a type column in the table to diffrentiate

    * TABLE_PER_CLASS 
      * Keeps Seperate table's for all

    * Cascading => 108
      * PERSIST => Save/Insert Child also when parent is is Saved
      * MERGE => Update/Insert Child also when parent is Saved/Updated
      * REMOVE => Delete Child also when parent is Deleted  
      * REFRESH => Refresh the parent object will automatically refresh child aobject
      * DETACH => Detach the parent object will automatically detach child object
      * ALL => DOES ALL of the above
      
    * LAZY & EAGER Loading (see from 111 to 115)
      * Earger => there is a join query and mapped to parent and child objects. Json will be created automatically

    * Hibernate Caching Mechanism(EH caching) -> Section 16 ->  productdata
      * There two levels of cache  - 134  
        * Session - Level1 
          * Each client has a hibernate session, and uses it to Query DB
          * Each client has it's own Cache
          * come's in by default
          * to make Level 1 caching to work we need to mark the method as @Transactional on the method
          * example 135
          * show's how to use entityManager in spring boot => 136
          * Evict -> remove an object from cache  
            * To remove from level1 cache => 136
            - @Autowired EntityManager entityManager => (javax.persistence.EntityManager)
              
              @Transactional
              // below code in a method
              Session session = entityManager.unwrap(Session.class);
              Product p = repository.findOne(1);
              repository.findOne(1);
              session.evict(p);
              repository.findOne(1);
               
        * SessionFactory - Level2
          * Session Factory is used to create multiple Sessions
          * has a common cache, and all sessions uses this cache
          * A Shared cache
          * EhCache/Redsi Cache
          
        * Properties For Cahcing => 139
          - spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache=true => Enabling second level cache
            spring.jpa.properties.javax.persistence.sharedCache.mode=ALL => mentioning that all should use shared cache
            
        * Cache Concurrency Strategy => 141
          * impacts the way caching is done in our application
          * READ_ONLY
            * used when the entites never change, only used in a read only applications
            - @Cache(usage=CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_ONLY) 
            * https://github.com/raj23manj/Hibernate_Basiscs/blob/master/productdata/src/main/java/com/rajesh/springdata/product/entities/Product.java
            
          * NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE
            * updates the cache only when a transaction completely commints the data to the database
            * Non-consistent data exist's, when two users access the same data, when one is updating and other is viewing.
            
          * READ_WRITE
            * if consistenty needed, like having locks in DB use this
            * in the same case mentioned above, when one user is updating a lock is added. When the other user makes a request see's the soft lock in cache
              goes to the DB directly and fetches
            
          * TRANSACTIONAL    
            * Rarely used
            * Used for distributed caching
          
        * EhCache(Inmemory/disk)
          * 137 - 143

  # Flushing => http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#pc-filter-join-table
    * the process of synchronizing the state of the persistence context with the underlying datbase
    * the flush operations take every entity state change and transalte it to an INSER, UPDATE or DELETE
    * Flush Modes
      * ALWAYS
        * The ALWAYS is only available with the native Session API.
        * The ALWAYS flush mode triggers a persistence context flush even when executing a native SQL query against the Session API.
      
      * AUTO 
        * Default Hibernate uses this mode
        
      * COMMIT
        * When executing a JPQL query, the persistence context is only flushed when the current running transaction is committed.
        
      * MANUAL   
        * Both the EntityManager and the Hibernate Session define a flush() method that, when called, triggers a manual flush.
          Hibernate also provides a MANUAL flush mode so the persistence context can only be flushed manually. 
  
  # Interceptors And Events 
    * http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#events     
    * https://www.boraji.com/hibernate-5-event-listener-example => good one    
    
    * Interceptors
      * The org.hibernate.Interceptor interface provides callbacks from the session to the application, allowing the application to inspect 
        and/or manipulate properties of a persistent object before it is saved, updated, deleted or loaded. 
        
      -  public static class LoggingInterceptor extends EmptyInterceptor {
         	@Override
         	public boolean onFlushDirty( // => Note this
         		Object entity,
         		Serializable id,
         		Object[] currentState,
         		Object[] previousState,
         		String[] propertyNames,
         		Type[] types) {
         			LOGGER.debugv( "Entity {0}#{1} changed from {2} to {3}",
         				entity.getClass().getSimpleName(),
         				id,
         				Arrays.toString( previousState ),
         				Arrays.toString( currentState )
         			);
         			return super.onFlushDirty( entity, id, currentState,
         				previousState, propertyNames, types
         		);
         	}
         }  
        
    * Native Event System
      *  If you have to react to particular events in the persistence layer, you can also use the Hibernate event architecture. 
         The event system can be used in place of or in addition to interceptors.
         
    * JPA Callbacks => http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#events-declarative-security
      * @PrePersist
        * Executed before the entity manager persist operation is actually executed or cascaded. This call is synchronous with the persist operation.
        
      * @PreRemove 
        * Executed before the entity manager remove operation is actually executed or cascaded. This call is synchronous with the remove operation.
        
      * @PostPersist 
        * Executed after the entity manager persist operation is actually executed or cascaded. This call is invoked after the database INSERT is executed.
        
      * @PostRemove
        * Executed after the entity manager remove operation is actually executed or cascaded. This call is synchronous with the remove operation.
        
      * @PreUpdate
        * Executed before the database UPDATE operation.
        
      * @PostUpdate
        * Executed after the database UPDATE operation.
        
      * @PostLoad 
        * Executed after an entity has been loaded into the current persistence context or an entity has been refreshed.   
        
      * There are two available approaches defined for specifying callback handling:
        * The first approach is to annotate methods on the entity itself to receive notifications of a particular entity lifecycle event(s).
        * The second is to use a separate entity listener class. An entity listener is a stateless class with a no-arg constructor. 
          The callback annotations are placed on a method of this class instead of the entity class. The entity listener class is then 
          associated with the entity using the javax.persistence.EntityListeners annotation

    * Default entity listeners  => see the example has good one 
      * http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#events-declarative-security     
      * The JPA specification allows you to define a default entity listener which is going to be applied for every entity in 
        that particular system. Default entity listeners can only be defined in XML mapping files.

# Bean Scope
  * Commonly used in Singleton and Prototype 
  * You Cannot override the built in Singleton and Prototype Scopes
     * Singleton (default) - only one instance of the bean is the created in the Ioc container
     * Prototype - A new instance is created each time the bean is requested
     * Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext
         * Request - A single instance per http request. 
         * Session - A Single instance per http session. 
         * Global-Session - A Single instance per global session. Typically only used in Portlet context(Legacy code).
         * Websocket - Scopes a single bean defenition to the lifecycle of a WebSocket
     * Custom Scope - Spring Scopes are extensible, and you can define your own scope by implementing Spring's 'Scope' interface.
     
  * Declaring Bean Scope:
    * No declaration needed for singleton scope.
    * In Java Configuration use @Scope annotation
    * In XML configuration scope is an XML attribute of the 'bean' tag

# Microservices
  * Bounded Context (Boundaries - figure out how to break build individual microservices)
  * Configuration Management (there will be multiple instances with different env's of each app, need to configure them) 
  * Dynamic Scale Up and Dynamic Scale Down (how many instance of each microservice should be running)
  * Visibility (centralized logging and monitoring with )
  * Fault tolerance
  
  * Advantages
    * Adaptation of new technologies and process(like node.js, kotlin etc)
    * Dynamic Scaling
    * Faster Release cycles

    * Setup a Centralized server config using Spring Cloud Config Server, 
      and spring cloud will distibute to other microservices
      
    * spring cloud netflix (Dynamic Scale up and Scale Down)
    
      * Spring cloud config server (package => config server)
          * Used for keeping a centralized different env properties for the applications
          * spring-microservices => 57      
          * spring-cloud-config-server folder
          * https://github.com/raj23manj/spring-microservices/blob/master/git_localconfig_repo_files/limits-service.properties
          * to make the config server to work we need to add 
            - @EnableConfigServer
          * we can access it from url to test  
        
        * Important on configurations on client service => 65
          * need to add spring cloud config client(for all client services), it will connect to the config server
          * based on the application name set below it will pick up the properties, and the profile
          * when using the spring cloud config server, the client which uses it should rename the application.properties to
            "bootstrap.properties". This file should have the name of its current application and the spring cloud config server
            uri. The below should be present on the client service(limits service), this will call automatically 
              - spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888 
                spring.application.name=limits-service
                spring.profiles.active=qa
          
          * if new properties are updated and pushed to git, need to restart the services. we can automate this 
          * there is a refresh link to do without restarting service, in the service which uses config server like limits service, need actuator => 100
            - disable the security on the actuators end-points
            - localhost:8080/actuator/refresh 
          * if multiple instances of the service are running, then we need to indivudually hit the url one by one, to avoid this and make one call
            so that all instances get refreshed, we need to use spring-cloud-bus  
        
      * Feign - RestFul Service Cleint, makes Easier to call REST Service using Rest Template using Proxy => 77
        1) Used for writing easier restful clients
        * it makes a proxy call 
        * to enable @EnableFeignClients
        * to interact with client
          - @FeignClient(name="currency-exchange-service", url="localhost:8000")
          - see currency-exchange-serivice proxy
        
      * Ribbon - Client Side Load Balancing => 78 & 79
        1) Make sure Load is balanced easily, between the multiple instance of a particular service
        * in pom set spring-cloud-starter-netflix-ribbon in the service client which (currency-conversion-service)
        * use this on the calling service 
          - @RibbonClient(name="currency-exchange-service")
          * Use to register all the instances of the service to be called that is running on, from the calling service
            * eureka handles this for us, a naming server, ribbon asks eureka what all instances of currency exchange are running and it gets back, hten ribbon invokes the appropriate service 
            - currency-exchange-service.ribbon.listOfServers=http://localhost:8000,http://localhost:8001  
        
      * Eureka - Naming Server - service discovery & service registration => 82
        1) all micro-services will register here, 
        2) service discovery - naming service will provide urls of current instance to asking microservice 
        * After setting up everything need to restart all services and eureka server and wait for 60 secs
        * Things to do in a service client that want's to register to eureka
            * need to add in pom 
              - spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client/eureka discovery
            * enable the discovery client 
              - @EnableDiscoveryClient  
            * using this in the service that want's to register with the naming server
              - eureka.client.service-url.default-zone=http://localhost:8761/eureka 
              
            * Distributing calls using eureka & ribbon => 84
              * eureka handles this for us, a naming server, ribbon asks eureka what all instances of currency exchange are running and it gets back, hten ribbon invokes the appropriate service 
              - #currency-exchange-service.ribbon.listOfServers=http://localhost:8000,http://localhost:8001   
              - for registration, it uses the application name we specify during registration with eureka "spring.application.name=currency-exchange-service"
                and use this same "spring.application.name" in the feign and ribbon to discover it. 
                
                - @FeignClient(name="currency-exchange-service") 
                - @RibbonClient(name="currency-exchange-service")
        
        * Eureka application setup
          - eureka server
          - config client => to have configuration in config server
          - @EnableEurekaServer
          * in application-properties
            - spring.application.name=netflix-eureka-naming-server
            - eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false => to avoid the this application to register itself
            - eureka.client.fetch-registry=false => to avoid fetching a registry
        
    * Visibilty, Monitoring, Gateway
      1) Netflix API Gateway (Zuul) 
        * common functionalities like logging, security etc across microservices can be done using this
        * Rate Litmis(no of requests per hour or day), fault tolerant(if service goes down, should send message)
        * Service Aggregation, an external call may many calls for one functionality, and it may contain many calls, we
          need toaggregate it 
        * can be used for server side load balancing  
        
        * Setup Zuul Server => 87, 88
          - zuul, eureka discovery
          - @EnableZuulProxy
          
        * Url Routing wihtout zuul routes setup using application name => 89
          - http://localhost:8765/{application-name}/{uri}  
          
        * For Feign interaction with other service, instead of doing it directly we need to do via zuul
          - remove this @FeignClient(name="currency-exchange-service")  
          - @FeignClient(name="netflix-zuul-api-gateway-server") // feign will interact with the zuul server and get the api from naming server  
            @GetMapping("/currency-exchange-service/currency-exchange/from/{from}/to/{to}")
        
        * Logging via zuul
          * log requests going through zuul  
          - https://github.com/raj23manj/spring-microservices/blob/master/netflix-zuul-api-gateway-server/src/main/java/com/in28minutes/microservices/netflixzuulapigatewayserver/ZuulLoggingFilter.java

            }
          - pre/post/error filters
          - interception logic  
      
      2) Zipkin(Distibute Tracing system) & sleuth(Distibute Tracing) 
        * add it to zuul application
        * Consolidate all logs from all the services and put it in a rabbit mq and send it to the zipkin server 
        * https://dzone.com/articles/spring-cloud-amp-spring-bootimplementing-zipkin-se
       
        * Sleuth(assigns Id to requests, across all services) 
          * Spring Cloud Sleuth assigns Id to requests, and is used to trace across multiple components   
          * need to add it to services and zuul app
            - spring-cloud-starter-sleuth  
          * to intercept all requests     
            * create a sampler, in zuul application and the services that implements sleuth
            - @Bean
             	public Sampler defaultSampler() {
             		return Sampler.ALWAYS_SAMPLE;
             	}
          * for one request(which might contain call to other services from one service like nested), there will be same id assigned by
            sleuth, and it automatically takes care of it   
          * we can check this id individually on the server logs, it is difficult to maintain hence use zipkin  	
             	
        * Zipkin => 93
          * need to install rabbit mq
          * download zipkin server, and make zipkin listen to rabbit mq
          * localhost:9411
          * RABBIT_URI=amqp://localhost java -jar zipkin-server-2.11.12-exec.jar    => make zipkin listen to rabbit mq
          * used to centralize all the request with the id's assigned by sleuth to one place, a centralized dashboard  
          
          * now make the services to put the messages to rabbit mq => 98
            * we need to add dependencies to the services
            - spring-cloud-starter-sleuth-zipkin => used for giving sleuth id's in the format zipkin accepts	     
            - spring-cloud-bus-amqp(for old version of spring boot) => spring-rabbit(new version of spring boot)
              * https://www.udemy.com/microservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud/learn/v4/t/lecture/12451184?start=0
              
    * Spring-Cloud-Bus => 102
      * we can use rabbit mq, kafka multiple options available
      * if multiple instances of the service are running, then we need to individually hit the url one by one, to avoid this and make one call
        so that all instances get refreshed, we need to use spring-cloud-bus     
      * issue with finchely implementing with spring boot 2.0.2+ => 101
      * use "spring-rabbit" to connect the services to rabbit mq
      * diable the security for actuators
      * hit the url "/actuator/bus-refresh" => in this case on limits service, this will refresh all instances of limits service
      
      * how it works
        * on the start-up of the services all the instace's register with the rabbit-mq bus
        * if there is a chnage in the config server, and hit the refresh url on any one of the instances will create a event to refresh other instances on the cloud
          bus, and the cloud bus will propogate this to all the instances
        * once we add all the right dependencies, spring will auto configure all for us, seeing an rabbit-mq dependency in the class path, it will automatically configure    
                    
    * Fault Tolerance => 103

      - https://howtodoinjava.com/spring-cloud/spring-hystrix-circuit-breaker-tutorial/
      1) Hystrix - if a service is down, hystrix helps to configure a default response. 
      * if the service is down it need's respond back to the other service that it is down so that the other service which is dependent on it
        can handle it
      * need to add this to service
        - spring-cloud-starter-netflix-hystrix
        - @EnableHystrix
        * and on all the controller method need to add
          - @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod="fallbackRetrieveConfiguration")
        
      
    * Microservice Setup
      1) Start them in the order - Naming Server, Distributed Tracing Server, API Gateway, Calculation Service, Exchange Service      
      2) Wait for a couple of minutes      
      3) Run the Service that you would want to execute! (hit hte url)

    * Eureka Client & Server
    * OpenFeign
    * Ribbon Client Load Balancer  
    
    * uses
      * it abstracts the physical IP's of the instance's on the client and maintains on the eureka server,
        the client can access it using the service discovery by its service name
      * if one of the instances is down it will take care of rerouting the requests to other instances  
      * All the services registered will send regular heart beats to the eureka client to make sure it is up and running
      * There will be one instance on eureka server running, if it fails entire architecture fails, to avoid this we can have 
        another one step as back up (cluster of load balancer). It increases the cost and complexcity. In this case each instance
        interact with each other to check if it is down or up and share the service lookup state with each other, if a node in the cluster fails
        peer nodes make sure they are active and running 
    
    * Eureka Server - server side setup     
      * select Eureka-server from components
      * whenever we run a eureka server, it assumes that it is a node and is a part of a cluster, so it needs to register itself to other
        node. If there is only one instance running then we need to make sure it does not register's with itself
        - eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false/true
      * when the client is running it tries to fetch a local registry from the eureka server to speed up the process if multiple nodes of eureka
        are present in the cluster, as we have one we can disable it
        - eureka.client.fetch-registry=false
      * Once the eureka server is up and clients register, it takes adefault of 30 secs to wait before it appears on the dashboard. The reason for 
        this is the client after registering tries to give a heart beat at an interval of 10s for three time, and the eureka sever verifies it 
        once it is successful it shows up on the dashboard, and then singnals that this service can be used. In development phase we can reduce this
        time to 5 secs
        - eureka.server.wait-time-in-ms-when-sync-empty=5
      * when the eureka service starts up, it tries to fetch the registry information from the other nodes(peer nodes) it cluster aswell, it tries for 5 times  
        - eureka.server.registry-sync-retries=3
      * when eureka starts up, it starts thread to replicate the states with the peer discovery nodes. So that all the nodes in the cluster can be at the
        same place to share the information the consumers

          - eureka.client.register-with-eureka=true
        * to cache the registry of the eureka service locally, so that for every request call it can look up this cache and not hit the eureka server.
          This cache refresh's periodically. Optimises the performance
          - eureka.client.fetch-registry=true
        * this property is used not display the entry of the client on eureka server Dashboard it goes down after defined seconds
          - eureka.server.eviction-interval-timer-in-ms=15000
        * when the service comes online and sends a heart beat without registration, it recieves back response as "not found" from the server, the client
          then tries itself to register which takes 30 sec's by default and can be controlled, this is the reason why there is delay in the dashboard of the 
          client entry registry. best not change it from 30 or reduce it, self-preservation presumes that heartbeats are at interval of 30 secs, it change it to
          3 sec's, then self-preservation gets affected
          - eureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds=30
        * if a service shuts down or gets killed, it immediately does not remove the entry instead eureka server sends 3 consecutive missing heart beats, 
          and after 90 sec's it marks as dead and deletes the entry from the registry
          - eureka.instance.leaseExpirationDurationInSeconds=90
        * how the instance will be displayed on the dashboard, format
          - eureka.instance.instance-id=${spring.application.name}:${server.port}
        * tell the service to register with eureka servers with IP address instead of host names. In container environment this is best as hostname is randomly
          assigned and dns name is not available for container based deployment
          - eureka.instance.prefer-ip-address=true
  
        * Self-Preservation
          * a feature to minimize the registry inconsistency between the servers. If eureka server does not recieve consecutive heart beats then it will mark,
            as dead or expire it from registry when they don't recieve beyond a certain threshold
    
      * Setting up of clusters of Eureka Services
        * each eureka node instance in a cluster is a client for it's peer and need to register itself, for this we need to add a vaild peer eureka
          instance server URL
        * all the services will register will all the nodes of eureka servers in the cluster automatically 
        * when multiple instances are running, the client request are not sent to both eureka instances, when requesting for a registry eureka sends
          only one registry of the node, this is sharing attribute of the cluster to register both the instances  
            
      * Consuming the api exposed by the provider after registering with eureka
        * eureka client uses ribbon to the registry from eureka server with all the instances of registere client's locally and with that
          eureka client gives us a method to find an application by name
          -  import com.netflix.discovery.shared.Application;
             Application app = eurekaClient.getApplication("currency-conversion");  
      
      * Using Ribbon Load Balancer
        * Eureka client uses ribbon as load balancer, we can manually do this by usi a annotation @LoadBalanced on a RestTemplate as bean, which behind uses ribbon load 
          balancer by intercepting the requests 
        * By default when requesting with the service-name, ribbon resolves it automatically  and gives chances to all other services 
        * Ribbon does a round robbin among all the instances to keep it efficient  
        
        - in the bootstrap class(@SpringBootApplication) add, making the rest template aware of load balancer client
          @LoadBalanced
          	@Bean
          	public RestTemplate getRestTemplate() {
          		return new RestTemplate();
          	}
            
            
          in controller, using service name ribbon resolves by load balancing
          ResponseEntity<CurrencyConversionVO> responseEntity = restTemplate.getForEntity(
          					"http://currency-conversion/api/v1/from/{from}/to/{to}", CurrencyConversionVO.class,
          					urlPathVariables);
          					
      * Using Feign          
        * To abstract rest based calls to other services
        * We need define an interface and annotate it with spiring cloud annotaions, to map what eureka based service ribbon will invoke. It is
          the responsibilty of the spring cloud framework now to generate a proxy calls on the fly, that will be used to invoke a targeted  service.
        * on the client service which uses feign to make calls, we need to declare them all under same packages so that it contains all thw feign client 
          proxies
        * the interface should have same method signature as the actual call, to proxy it with same path as well          
        * with degin proxy we need to do "@PathVariable("from")", it does not bind automatically  
        - @FeignClient(name = "currency-conversion")
          @RequestMapping(value = "/api/v1")
          public interface CurrencyConversionServiceProxy {
          	@GetMapping(value = "/from/{from}/to/{to}")
          	public CurrencyConversionVO convertCurrency(@PathVariable("from") String from, @PathVariable("to") String to);
          }   
        
        * when using fegin client it throws only feginexception for any error situation, but if we need application specific exception  
          it can be done by our own implementation of error decoder that is available using feign.builder.errordecoder

      * Zuul Service Gateway
      * Routing
      - <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-zuul</artifactId>
        </dependency>
      
      * @EnableZuulProxy, in application bootsrap class  
        * this adds zuul level proxy filters and integration capabilities for eureka service discovery
      
      * If we do not want to use zuul provided routing filters and eureka discovery and implement our own then we need to add
        * @EnableZuulServer
        
      * Zuul gateway is a reverse proxy, it accepts the request from clients and forwards it to the services and does manupliations inbetween as well  
      
      * the actuator on the zuul, on hitting the get routes url, it hits the eureka server and gets a json payload of the routes, this has the details of the
        routes managed by Zuul  
        
      * if any of the client service is down, eureka will not retunr any routes for that service  
      
      * Zuul has 3 mechanisms to route to the services
        * 1) if any routes are not configured  explicitly, then it uses the service discovery to resovle the incoming requests
        * 2) Another way is to configure routes explictly which at the end are shared with the consumers and use service discovery engine to resolve the physical
             location
        * 3) last way is to define routes and map it to the static URL's, instead of using discovery engine 
        
      
      * 1) Automatic discovery of routes using eureka 
        * Zuul server has eureka client that talks to the Eureka server and gets the registry 
        * when we hit /currency-conversion/api/v1/from/USD/to/INR, zuul takes "currency-conversion" from the url, checks it with the regitry it has
          if it finds an mapping in Json, it will take that name and call eureka to resolve it to the actual location, and constructs the url 
          and sends it
      
      2) This method is used when we want to shorten the service-name, or use a different name for the routes and map it to the existing service 
         in eureka. But when the currency-conversion service is down, we won't get key-value pair for it, but "/cc/**" will be there, coz it is on zuul
        - zuul.routes.currency-conversion=/cc/**
          - the name after routes is taken from after hitting actuator/routes, the key
            {
              /flight-schedule/**: "flight-schedule",
              /currency-conversion/**: "currency-conversion"
            }
            
      3) Manual Custom routes  
         * need to set properties 
         - zuul.routes.greeting-service.serviceId=greet
           zuul.routes.greeting-service.path=/greet/**
           zuul.routes.greeting-service.url=http://localhost:9999    
         
      * properties
        * add custom routes mapping to service-name
          - zuul.routes.currency-conversion=/cc/**
        *  after doing the previous step, to remove entry of default one use this
          - zuul.ignored-services=currency-conversion
        * use to set prefix for the route, flights/cc/**
          - zuul.prefix=/flights
        * Setting a id for the service 
          - zuul.routes.greeting-service.serviceId=greet
        * setting custom manual route
          - zuul.routes.greeting-service.path=/greet/**
        * setting manual location
          - zuul.routes.greeting-service.url=http://localhost:9999
          
      * Zuul Filters
        * 3 types of filters are present in zuul
          * Pre Filters (Authentication Filters)
            * Can implement auhtentication and authorization
          * Route Filters
            * invoked after pre filters, but just before the request is sent to the destination service
            * best place for making decision based dynamic routing 
            * example, if we have two versions of a service, if we want to route 30-70 ratio, it can be done here 
          * Post Filters (Response Audit Filters) 
            * this filter is invoked when the response from service is done and ready to respond with response to the client  
            * we can override the response here
            * perform auditing here
            
        * Implementation of filters => section 6, 40
          * to implement ZuulFilter - Base Abstract Class this we need override the methods
            * filterType() => to classify type of filter - pre, post, route
            * filterOrder() => to define the execution order of the filter
            * shouldFilter() => is the filter active or not
            * run() => write the filter logic
          * Predecoration Filter - ServiceId, in ZuulFilter
            * // this service-id will be only set after pre-decoration filter
              Object serviceId = ctx.get("serviceId");  
              
        * Zuul Routing filters  section 6, 42    
          * Zuul comes up with its own routing logic, and it achieves this using
            * SimpleHostRoutingFilter
            * RibbonRoutingFilter
            * when using this filter and trying to send the current request to a new request, then
              we need to discard the current route request. To do that,
                //disable SimpleHostRoutingFilter
                ctx.setRouteHost(null);
                
                //disable RibbonRouting Filter
                ctx.remove(serviceId); 
            
    # Microservice security
      * https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/issues/162 
      * pass jwt between microservices
        * https://keyholesoftware.com/2016/06/20/json-web-tokens-with-spring-cloud-microservices/
        * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47362618/spring-cloud-zuul-pass-jwt-downstream  
      
      Our target architecture is several small microservices, Eureka as service registry and Zuul as edge servers.
      We using JWT-based auth mechanism.
      The question is - how to organize auth? Use custom-written Zuul Filters on Edge or auth and pass plain requests to downstream servers or use Spring Security on the front-door and use Zuul only for routing?
      Or pass JWT token to downstream servers and write some custom stuff for each service?
      
      Client sends POST /api/login request to Zuul
      Zuul sees that this request does not contain JWT token in header
      Zuul redirects request to Auth server
      Downstream perform auth and in successful case responses with Token
      Zuul returns token to client
      Client uses this token in following requests
      When client sends request with JWT token Zuul figures out this and parsed it. It is able to parse since the secret key is also stored on Zuul.
      Zuul parses token and break it into several fields - user id and role.
      Zuul sets custom headers
      All downstream services use custom filter who takes user id and role from headers and transforms it into Spring Security auth object or whatever.

      * https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/issues/117
      * https://exampledriven.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/spring-cloud-hystrix-example/ => this worked
    * Circuit Breaker
      * This makes sure that client will not call to service that is failing  repeatedly or responding poorly, to have rich user experience
      * Hystrix Closely monitor's each service call and if calls get failed frequently, it fails fast to close the circuit, 
        then it opens the circuit to source for alternate source of data, hystrix checks if the calls to service is working and if
        it does it closes the circuit to normal path for service execution
        
      * Fallback Approach
        * implements another source for data  
        
      * Bulk Head Approach  
        * This approach seggregates the service calls into multiple thread pools, to ensure that degredation of the system will affect the execution
           part 
        * Each service  will be assigned to a thread   
        * Hystrix provides an option of processing of the services in multiple thread pools

        * in bootstrap class
          - @EnableCircuitBreaker => tell to enable hystrx circuit breakers for the service 
      
      * Annotation Based    
          * @HystrixCommand
            * by default it wait's for 1 sec then throws exception, if this annotation is added to the methods
            * we use this annotation to wrap the method which has potentially a risky functionality in it, for example a call for the DB or
              a call over the network 
            * During the deployment time, when spring finds this annotation, it generates a proxy and wraps this method to take control of its execution
              by one of the thread managed by one of the threads managed by the thread pool hystrix        
            * whenever a call is made, hystrix expects a responce within a second range, if not it throws the Hystrix runtime exception expalning the
              time out
            * It tell to wait for 7s and the hystrix property for it is  
            - @HystrixCommand(commandProperties = {
                        @HystrixProperty(name = "execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds", value = "7000") })  
            * List of properties
              * https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Configuration#introduction
              
      * Property Based
        * set the command properties as key value pair or use method name in the propery file to set the values          			
        - hystrix.command.getFlightsKey.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds=3000
          #hystrix.command.getFLights.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds=3000 => not good, methods name might be same in other class
    
      * Fallback Strategy
        * This is the right way in doing hystrix, we should not increase the time, but if it takes more time we need to implement
          a fallback method to respond back to the client with alternate response 
        * the reason for interruption might be due to some exception, error in service or due to interruption by hystrix command to service
          calling thread due to delay in the response by the service 
        * The fall back method defined should have the same signature of the actual calling method.
          - public List<Flight> getFLights(String from, String to){};
          - public List<Flight> buildFallbackFlights(String from, String to) {}   
          * reduce the time aswell 
            - hystrix.command.getFlightsKey.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds=3000
            
      * Bulk Head Strategy
        * By default when we annotate our bootstrap class with @EnableCircuitBreaker, Hystrix on the start up of the service creates a thread
          pool and all the calls to the method which are annotated with @HystrixCommand are processed by a thread in the thread pool, so when we have 
          multiple functionalities defined in our service which are again dependent on other down stream services and we have annotated the functionalities
          with @HystrixCommand and calls to all the functionalites will be severved by the threads in the same thread pool. 
        * Let's assume one of the dependent service is not performing well, so can block the threads of the thread pool which can affect other functionalities 
          due to unavailability of the threads. Bulk head Strategy comes to rescue, we can place remote service calls to its own thread pool with a configuration
          of number of thread, usage etc so that bad performing services should not affect other service calls to avoid sysem degradation and crash at last 
        - @HystrixCommand(commandKey="getFlightsKey", fallbackMethod="buildFallbackFlights", threadPoolKey="getFlightsThreadPool",
          			threadPoolProperties= {
          					@HystrixProperty(name="coreSize", value="1"), @HystrixProperty(name="maxQueueSize", value="2")
          			})
          			
            * coresize => used to set the number of core threads needs to be available for the processing at the max
            * maxQueueSize => quesize to hold the requests if thread is not available 	
            
      * How Hystrix works behind the scene
        * if a request is failing contineously to serve, Hystrix monitors it if fails beyond a threshold limit, if it stops making requests
          to service for a certain point of time, in order to give service the time to recover or to resume if down and forward the request to fallback path
          to serve the request if implemented this process is called short circuit. This is the characteristics os a Circuit breaker       
        * The Monitoring is controlled by three properties 
          * Time Window   	
            * it is used by hystrix to observer how often the service call is having the problem 
          * Number of service call  
            * There is threshold for service call number, to identify how many calls are getting failed	  
          * Failure Rate
            * There is threshold of failure rate that defines whether circuit should be open or not, default is 10 sec. 
          * When first call gets failed, hystrix starts monitoring
            for next 10 secs, if for the next 10 sec the number of request coming to the system remains lower then the configured number of service call, it 
            does not take action regarding circuit trip. But if it crosses the limit next it checks how many calls are getting failed, if the failure ratio
            crosses the configured failure rate, then hystrix open the circuit the and fail fast the circuit call. 
          * when the circuit is open it does mean it open all the time, after opening it checks if the failed service is resumed or working fine again, this
            checking is done in a periodic interval      
      
      * Customization properties
        * For Time Window
          - hystrix.command.getFlightsKey.metrics.rollingStats.timeInMilliseconds=15000
        * It denotes the number of calls that must occur in the observation window, in above mentioned 15 sec time window 
          - hystrix.command.getFlightsKey.circuitBreaker.requestVolumeThreshold=10
        * The % of calls that must fail during the observation window due to exception or timeout
          - hystrix.command.getFlightsKey.circuitBreaker.errorThresholdPercentage=50
        * Time window aftre which hystrix will check if service is working, to close the circuit
          - hystrix.command.getFlightsKey.circuitBreaker.sleepWindowInMilliseconds=6
  
  * Distributed Tracing(Sleuth, Zipkin, Hystrix dashboard, Turbine Stream)
    * Sleuth
      * implements distributed tracing solution
      * responsible for generating tracing ID, and handles the complexcities in tracing and the propagation as well
      * it adds the tracing information to slf4j mapped diagonistic context(mvc), so that the information can be further sent to a aggregator 
        for further analysis at a central place   
      * it has good implementation with zipkin tracing system and publish the tracing information to zipkin  
    
    * Zipkin server & UI
      * it is a distributed tracing system, helps record timing, meta data of operations executed in the microservice architecture and give a visual
        representation to the users for the actions across the system 
        
    * Hysrix Dashboard & Turbine
      * used to monitor the hystrix metrics, when the @hystrixCommand is introduced into the service it publishes metrics to the operational events using
        turbine streams which hystrix dashboard consume and display it on the dashboard. 
        
    * Implementation       
       * Sleuth
           - <!-- Sleuth Client -->
             <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
             </dependency>
           * Sleuth will inspect all the incoming services for the tracing information, and will inject it if it is not present for logging purpose.
           * it also maintains propogation of this ID when forwards the requests to dowstream service calls.
       
          * Output
              * Format: servicename - TraceID - Trace span ID - Boolean Variable
                * TraceID will be same for all the services
                * Trace Span ID will be generated for every service call
                * boolean variable represents whether the trace information has been sent to zipkin server or not
                
                - example:
                  zuul-service-gateway,d17b49e4256dff07,d17b49e4256dff07,false
                  flight-fare,d17b49e4256dff07,48f210561e30f115,false   
                  currency-conversion,d17b49e4256dff07,61c62da6ecc8e7be,false
                  
       * Zipkin Server
          * we can't do like eureka server a seperate server
          * helps us view the transactional flow across the services visually  
          * it shows the time taken for a transaction, and breaking down individually how long each service took 
          * There is issue with setting up of zipkin server, we need to do it by set it up using this
            https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart.html (Running from source) or the java one
          * it runs on port http://localhost:9411/zipkin/          
          
          * on the client service
            - <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</artifactId>
            </dependency> 
            
            * zipkin uses amqp to process the traces, recieve the traces from services. SO we need it to be running
            * properties to set on client
              *
                - ribbon.readTimeout=60000
              * by default no span id is sent to zipkin server can be seen only in log. This property allows us to define
                the probability of sending traces to Zipkin server. Value is from 1-100, 100 means send every sample to zipkin 
                  
                - spring.sleuth.sampler.probability=100
              * used to set the URL of zipkin running server
                - #Not mandatory; this is the default value
                - spring.zipkin.baseUrl=http://localhost:9411  
            
            * need to download and install rabbit mq(see below for rabbit mq), and set zipkin to listen to it and restart zipkin    
              - RABBIT_URI=amqp://localhost java -jar zipkin-server-2.11.12-exec.jar

        - only instance methods to be can be overriden not static methods 
        - while overriding the method or variable can't have a lower access modifier
          - ex if parent method is protected then using private in child will throw errr, but making it public is allowed 
        - methods that are final cannot be overriden  
      * Static Methods, varaibles
        - declared using static
        - these methods can't access instance methods and instance variables direclty
        - these are used for operations that don't require any data from an instance of class, ex calculate discount 
        - no access to this 
        - static varaible shared among all objects of class

           - ArrayList<IntClass> arr = new ArrayList<IntClass>();
           - arr.add(new IntClass(23));
      * Hence Collections can't hod primitive type directly, but can hold objects hence we need to box and unbox the primitive types.
      * There are pre built classes for Primitive Types provided by Java 
        - Integer 
          - Longer Way
              - ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>(); 
                - arr.add(Integer.valueOf(23)); => Auto Boxing
                - arr.get(23).intValue(); => Unboxing
              - adding a new value like setter, Integer.valueOf(23) => boxing
              - like getter to get the value,  arr.get(index).intValue();
          - Shorter Way => Java takes care of it at compile time and it converts to above boxing format
            - Integer myVal = 23; => Auto Boxing => Integer.valueOf(23)
            - int myInt = myVal; => Unboxing =>  myVal.intValue()    
        - Double
        -                 
        
  # Arrays & Lists => ArrayLists
    * Arrays are contiguous memory
    * fixed time access based on index, very fast
    * Array
        * int[] myVAr = new String[10]#{1,2,3};     
        * int[] myVar = #new int[1,2,3]  
    * List
      * Ordered Collection
      * ArrayList<Integer> myVar = new ArrayList(); // new ArrayList<Integer>();     
        * add, size, set(position, item) => update, remove(position), contains, indexOf(item), get(index/position)
  
  # LinkedList
    * In array list if only adding new elements and deleting elements will work better like stack without adding any new 
      elements or deleting inbetween the list at any random position, but if a element needs to be added at specific position then
      shuffeling the elements takes time, hence Linked list can save time   
      
    * LinkedList<String> arr = new LinkedList<String>();  
    
  # Interfaces => https://www.baeldung.com/java-static-default-methods
    * Class that needs to implement will be defined here used by different classes
    * methods with definition can be defined like modules
    * static methods with definition will be class methods
    * interfaces are contracts
    * methods by default are public and abstract 
    * from java 9 onwards interfaces can contain private methods 
    * default methods acts like instance methods   => https://dzone.com/articles/interface-default-methods-java
    - public interface oldInterface {
          public void existingMethod();
          
          default public void newDefaultMethod() {
            System.out.println("New default method" " is added in interface");

  # Inner Classes / Anonomyous Class => like compositions
    * Nesting classes
    * 4 types 
      * Static Nested classes 
        * Mainly used to associate a class with its outer class
        * Packaged inside the outer class
        * this class cannot access non static members of it's outer class without creating an instance of it
        
      * Non Static Nested Class => (Inner class) => used much
        * importtant, the data variable used for both classes needs to be different, or else child class will shadow 
          parent class variables

          - GearBox gb = new GearBox(6);
          - GearBox.Gear first = gb.new Gear(1, 12.3) => using the instance of GearBox
          - // GearBox.Gear second = new GearBox.Gear(1, 12.3) => won't work for non static inner classes
          
        * As a good programming practice,
          * it will be good if we make the inner class private, and create a method to instantiate a new object of 
            Gear box and expose it, and use it's method just like delegation in composition  
      
      * Local Class => not much used
        * inner class defined inside a scope block which is a method
        * Scope restricted to that block
          -  see 105 pretty complex(Tim)
        * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/local-inner-class-java/
        * Local Inner Classes are the inner classes that are defined inside a block. Generally, this block is a method 
          body. Sometimes this block can be a for loop, or an if clause.Local Inner classes are not a member of any 
          enclosing classes. They belong to the block they are defined within, due of which local inner classes cannot 
          have any access modifiers associated with them. However, they can be marked as final or abstract. These class 
          have access to the fields of the class enclosing it. Local inner class must be instantiated in the block they 
          are defined in

          * Difference between Normal/Regular class and Anonymous Inner class:
            
            * A normal class can implement any number of interfaces but anonymous inner class can implement only one 
            interface at a time.
            * A regular class can extend a class and implement any number of interface simultaneously. But anonymous 
              Inner class can extend a class or can implement an interface but not both at a time.
            * For regular/normal class, we can write any number of constructors but we cant write any constructor for 
              anonymous Inner class because anonymous class does not have any name and while defining constructor class 
              name and constructor name must be same.
              
  # Abstract Class
    * when implementaions has to hidden from users, make only those abstract methods and let child classes implement it.
    * this class cannot be instantiated
    * can have abstract methods, without implementations
    * the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However, 
      if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract 
    * we can declare fields that are not static and final
    * we can define public, protected and private methods   
    * it can extend from one parent only

          return name;
        }
      }   
      
  # Abstract Vs Interface
    * Use abstract when there exists "is a" relationship like inheritance  dog is a animal 
    * Use Interface  when there exists "can" relationship
      - Animal -> bird and mamals
      - bird can fly
      - mamal -> bat can fly
      - use interface here

    * introduction to collections and Generics in Java
      * Generics help to reduce runtime bugs to copile time bugs(easier to detect and fix) 
      * Used to implement generic algorithm
      * avoid casting, it is expensive
      
      * Multiple Type Parameter:
        class HashTable<T,E>
      
      * Array Method
        public<T> void show(T[] array)  
      
      * Bounded Types
        * Restrict type of typed arguments  
        * Generic that implements an interface
          * public static <T extends Comparable<T>> T cal(T ti, T t2)
          
      * Type Inference
        * compilers ability to look at each method invocation and corresponding declarations to determine the type arguments
          that make the invocation applicable  
          
      * Unbounded wildcards
        * Collection<?>  
            
      * Upper Bound WildCard(for read)
        * "? extends T" 
        * accepts any subclasses of type T 
        * cast to type "T" while iterating
        * can be used only to read from list not add in list, if needed use LowerBound
      
      * Lower Bound Wildcard(for write)
        * "? super T"   
        * reading -> not guaranteed an integer because it may be pointing to a number, the only guarantee is an object or sub class of object. ~ you can cast to object while iterating
          writing -> you can not add Object or serializable to a List<? super Number> even though Number extends Object and serialisable. You
                     can add Integer or double, which are sub types of number 
                     
      * If we wnat to add and read at the same time, we have to declare the collection with no wild card. List<Double>  
      
      * Type erasure 
        * java uses type erasure to handle generics
        * replace all type parameters in generic types with their bounds or Object. If the type parameters are unbounded
          So the final bytecode will contain plain java objects/classes. Uses type casts if necessary
        * sometimes it generates extra methods called bridge methods in order to maintain polymorphism with generic types  
        * Bridge methods are usually occur when inheritance is used. It is an additional method during type erasure in order to avoid ambiguous
          situations.
        
    * Collections:
      * collection extends the Iterable interface
      * List(ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector(synchronised) -> Stack), Queue(priorityQueue, Deque -> ArrayDeque), Set(HashSet, LinkedHashSet, SortedSet -> TreeSet)
      * Map (HashTable(synchronised), HashMap, LinkedHashMap, SortedMap -> TreeMap)
                           
      
  # Static & Final
    * Static
        * used for creating class methods and variables
        
    * Static Intializers  => Static equivalent of constructors  
        * Static blocks, can also be created these are called before the constructors
        * will be executed once when the class is loaded 
        - public class Test {

          }
          
          Test() {}
        }
        
    * Final 
        * Used for constant's
        * Not to be modified
        * when the class constructor is called it can be changed
        * can be used to stop overriding methods in subclass

        * Collection.Sort(List<T> list, Comparator<? super T> c) 
        * if we need to override the default logic done by comparable in the class, then use this
        * Collections have sort alogrithms to use the and sort based on logic, this logic will be mentioned in the 
          comparator method  
        * Use Comparator for custom sort logic, using anonmouys class
        - static final Comparator<Seat> Price_Order = new Comparator<Seat>() {
          @Override
          public int compare(Seat seat1, Seat seat2) {
          // logic -1 is less, 0 is equal, 1 is greater
            return -1 or 0 or 1
          }
        };
        
        - Collection.sort(seats, Theater.Price_Order)  
        
      * Minor Known Issue if value comparing are equal
        * ordering being inconsistent between equals
        * need to pass 0 if equal  
        * in this case need to add additional condition for equals
    
     
    * Map(Dictonaries) => {a => 'b'}, {a => [1,2,3]}
        * HashMap and Linked HashMap => unique keys
        * need to override HashCode
    
      * SortedMap  
      
    * All implement collection interface

    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr56SlbMed4 => good
    
    * In HashMap and HashSet there will be no duplicates(key;s in HashMapn and value's in HashSet). Two different objects
      can have same hashing value and be put in the same bucket, when comparing it uses equalTo() method, when object same
      values are present with same hashcode it first checks with equals then rejects
    
    * equalsTo()
      * check if two objects are equal
      * by default it will only check for two objects are instances of the same class 
      * need oveeriding so we can customise
      
      
    *  hashcode() 
      * returns an integer which is the memory location of the item 
      * helps to identify on object in an heap of objects in the memory
      * helps in performance (searching elements)
      * need to be unique
    
    * when to override them
      * You must override hashCode() in every class that overrides equals().
      * Collections such as HashMap and HashSet use a hashcode value of an object to determine how it should be stored 
        inside a collection, and the hashcode is used again in order to locate the object in its collection.

  # immutable classes
    * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-immutable-class-java/
    * immutable class means that once an object is created, we cannot change its content. In Java, all the wrapper classes (like String, Boolean, Byte, Short) and String class is immutable. We can create our own immutable class as well.
      
    * Following are the requirements:
      • Class must be declared as final (So that child classes can’t be created)
      • Data members in the class must be declared as final (So that we can’t change the value of it after object creation)
      • A parameterized constructor
      • Getter method for all the variables in it
      • No setters(To not have option to change the value of the instance variable)  
     
    -  public final class Student 
       { 
           final String name; 
           final int regNo; 
         
           public Student(String name, int regNo) 
           { 
               this.name = name; 
               this.regNo = regNo; 
           } 
           public String getName() 
           { 
               return name; 
           } 
           public int getRegNo() 
           { 
               return regNo; 
           } 
       }   
            
  # Set and HashSet
    * No duplicates
    * Ordered sets

  # Threads/Concurrency 
    * Application or Process refers same and has one thread, each thread can have multiple threads
    * Each thread has it's own heap of memory space  
    * Threads Creadted by a process shares the same resources anf files of the parent thread or process
    * Each Thread has it's own thread stack      
    * Every Java Application runs as a single process or thread, each process can have multiple threads. 
      each process has a heap and each process has a  thread stack.
    * Concurrency means, dowload some data draw on screen, then repeat.  
    * Not allowed to start the instance of thread more than onceif needed create a sub class
      of Thread Class and run multiple instances
    * Two ways of creating a Thread.
      1) Extend Thread Class and override "run()"
      2) Make the class implement Thread Class and implement "run()" method
    * A Thread will terminate once it returns from its run method after completing or else if it encounters a return statement  
    * When calling start() method after overriding run method it will execute in another thread, if run() itself is called, it will
      execute in the same thread
    * Interrupting a thread will terminate the thread, to interrup an thread we instance of that thread from the main thread.
    * We can make a thread to join with other thread and wake it up if it is sleeping   
       // when a thread is put to sleep here, anotherThread instead making it to sleep
       // for 3 sec's, we can make it join to this(myRunnableTHread) thread, once this
       // thread execution is completed it will start anotherThread, then it will execute the code following
       //  System.out.println(ANSI_RED + "another Thread terminated, so im running again"); 
    * When multiple threads(bank account example) are run with same instance(countdownclass - some work), the instances(countdownclass) 
      instance variable will be shared, i,e it will allocated on the heap and shared. if the variables are local
      variables on the instances(countdownclass) it will be added to the thread's Stack      
    * Race-Condition(Thread Interference): when multiple thread share the same resource and write them, leads to a race condition.
    * Synchronisation: To avoid race condition, we need to use synchronised methods or statements
      - Constructors cannot ne synchronised
      - not use local variables if using synchronisation  
      - we need to synchronise the code that only needs to be synchronised, like the for loop(int i), this will affect performance of application
      - Methods that can be only called inside synchronised code: (Pub/Sub)
        - wait() : 
           - it release the locks it is holding(current thread) for the other thread to execute
           - always needs to be called inside the loop, so that if it misses the conditions, it will go back to begining of the loop
        - notify() :
          - notify a particular thread
        - notifyAll() :
          - notify all the threads
    * Locks: Also used to avoid race conditions, it is used on statements. When one thread has a lock other threads are suspended and
      wait until lock is free  
    * Critical sections means, all the shared resources(variables) are made synchronised
    * Thread Safe, means the developer whos has developed the code has handled the synchronise section. We as a developer need not worry about thread interference  
    * Not Thread Safe, means we as a developer need to make sure synchronisation is handled for multiple threads
    * There are some operation for which threads cannot be suspended, these are called Atomic operations that happens all at once and a thread connot be suspended while doing them, they are
      - Reading and writting refference variables
        ex: myobj1 = myobj2
      - Reading and writting of primitive variables except long, double 
        ex: int y =10; => cannot be suspended
            Long y =10; => can be suspended 
      - Declaring all variables as "volatile"      
    * Collections: (lecture 249, section 15)
      - Some collections are not thread safe
        ex: ArrayList 
    * java.util.concurrent package was introduced to run multiple threads, help dev's properly synchronise code
    * Reentrant Lock - when a thread is holding a lock and enters again it can execute
    * Thread Pool - manages the threads for us
      * Executor service https://www.baeldung.com/httpclient-guide
         ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
         (new Thread(r)).start(); => ex.execute(r);
    * ArrayBlockingQueue => Thread safe,  this is bounded and manages locks internally
      * methods to this put, take and pee all take lock for executing    
      
      
# Lambdas
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpIUfj3KaOc&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTa9YGfyhyW2CqdtW9RtY-I3&index=1
  
  * Enable us to write functional programming
  * enables support for parallel processing
  * Easier to use API's and Libraries
  
  * lambdas are functions that does not belong to a class, and exist in Isolation and these functions can be 
    treated as values.  
  
  * Scenario
    * imagine if i class has only one menthod and i want to call it, i need to instantiate the class. Instead if
      I could oly call or pass the method, that is where lambda's come in.
  
  * In Java 7
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL7H4F_ly_k&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTa9YGfyhyW2CqdtW9RtY-I3&index=5
    * we can do this by using interfaces and passing the instance of the class and calling the method
    
    
  * In Java 8 using Lambdas
    - aBlockOfCode = () -> {
                            System.out.print("Hello world");  
                            return null;  
                         };
                         
    - doubleNumberFunction = (int a) -> a * 2; => ((int a) -> return a * 2)
    
    - addFunction = (int a, int b) -> a + b; 
    
  * Types for lambdas
    * we can use an interface to declare lambda's
    * But the interface should have only method as per the lambda expression
    * we can use existing interfaces for types also
    
    - interface MyLambda {
        void foo();  
      }  
      
    - interface MyAdd {
         int add(int x, int y);  
       }                  
  
    - MyLambda aBlockOfCode = () -> { system.out.print("Hello") };
    - MyAdd addFunction = (int a, int b) -> a + b;
    - // an anonnomouys class
      MyAdd innerClassMyAdd = new MyAdd() {  // => see video 9 Java Brains
        public int add(int x, int y) {
          System.out.print(x, y);
        }
      }
    
    - aBlockOfCode.foo();
    - addFunction.add(1, 2); => since it implements the interface, the method name defined can be used to call 
    - innerClassMyAdd.add(1,2); 
  
  * Type Inference
    * used to figure out the type of lambdas belong to.
    * Looking at the interface method definition, java will also understand the type of method passed
    -  interface StringLambda {
        int getLength(String s);
      }
      
      StringLambda myLambda = (s) -> s.length // => (String s) => return s.length();
      myLambda.getLength('Hello');
  
  * Runnable Using Lambdas => Threads
    * Doing in Inner class way
      - Thread myThread = new Thread(new Runnable() { // Runnable is a interface
            @Override
            public void run() {
                    System.out.println("Printed Inside Runnable");
            }
       }) 
       
       myThread.run();        
    
    * Doing in Lambda Way
    - Thread myThread = new Thread(() ->  System.out.println("Printed Inside Runnable"); )
      myThread.run();
  
  * Functional Interface
    * For a Lambda Type we need one interface with only one abstract method with it's signature
    * We can create one in the normal way, but if in future a developer comes and changes it will cause problems. To 
      avoid this we mark it as "@FunctionalInterface", and it will enforce. This is optional
    - @FunctionalInterface
      public interface Greeting {
        public void perform();
      }
      
    * Java gives built functional interfaces for specific purposes
      * predicate
        * A predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables. 
          It can be thought of as a function that returns a value that is either true or false
          - Predicate<String> isALongWord = t -> t.length() > 10;   
      
      * Consumer   
        * This functional interface represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result. 
        The real outcome is the side-effects it produces. Since it's a functional interface, you can pass a lambda 
        expression wherever a Consumer is expected.
          - class Product {
              private double price = 0.0;
            
              public void setPrice(double price) {
                this.price = price;
              }
            
              public void printPrice() {
                System.out.println(price);
              }
            }
            
            public class Test {
              public static void main(String[] args) {
                Consumer<Product> updatePrice = p -> p.setPrice(5.9);
                Product p = new Product();
                updatePrice.accept(p);
                p.printPrice();
              }
            }
            
      * Function
        * This functional interface represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result. 
          One use, for example, it's to convert or transform from one object to another. Since it's a functional interface, 
          you can pass a lambda expression wherever a Function is expected.
          -  public class Test {
               public static void main(String[] args) {
                 int n = 5;
                 modifyTheValue(n, val-> val + 10);
                 modifyTheValue(n, val-> val * 100);
               }
             
               static void modifyValue(int v, Function<Integer, Integer> function){
                 int result = function.apply(v);
                 System.out.println(newValue);
               }
             
             }
             
      * Supplier
        *  This functional interface does the opposite of the Consumer, it takes no arguments but it returns some value. 
           It may return different values when it is being called more than once. Since it's a functional interface, 
           you can pass a lambda expression wherever a Supplier is expected.   
           -  public class Program {
                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                      int n = 3;
                      display(() -> n + 10);
                      display(() -> n + 100);
                  }
              
                  static void display(Supplier<Integer> arg) {
                      System.out.println(arg.get());
                  }
              }  
            
  * More Lambda Features(15, 16)
    * java.utils.functions  => has pre-defined functions for common use  
    * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/package-summary.html  
  
  * Exception Handling in Lambdas
    *  17 , 18
    *  using try/catch in the lambda itself
  
  * Closures in Lambdas
    * 19 
    * the way variables can be accessed in the scope of a function and the lambda
    
  * this reference in lambdas
    * 20  
   
  * Method Reference and Collections => little complex
    * 21 
    * Alternate way of writing lambdas
    * if arguments passed via the lambda and the params accepted by the function being called we can use this
    - public class Test{   
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> printMessage());//  => new Thread(Test::printMessage)
        public static void printMessage() {
          System.out.println("Hello");
        }  
      }
  
  * Java Iterations
    * 22
    * External Iterators(sequentional and ordered)
      - for(int i=0; i< array.size; i++) { System.out.println(array.get(i)) }
      - for(Person p : array) { System.out.println(p) }
      
    * internal Iterators in java 8, this runs in multiple threads, not ordered
      - array.forEach((p) -> System.out.println(p))

################### Testing

 * Helps maintain bug free code
 * Helps to modularise code

 # Concepts 
  * Unit Tests
    * Designed for specific sections of code
    * should be very fast
    * should not have external dependencies(no DB, no web service calls, no spring context)
  
  * Integration Tests
    * If need test behaviour between objects to see interaction
    * can include spring context, message broker etc ...
    * slower in running than unit tests
    
  * Functional Tests
    * Means testing a running application
    * Functional touch points are tested (using web driver, calling web services, sending/receiving messages)   
  
  * Importance 
    * write major of test cases as unit
    * then integration tests
    * functional tests 
    
  * Agile Testing Methods
    * TDD
      * write tests first, code to fix tests, refractor coe to cleanup, improve
    * BDD(cucumber)   
      * similar to TDD
      * describe the excepted behaviour of software
      * often expressed as: when/then; given/when/then
      
  * Testing components
    * Mocks
      * a fake implementation of a class used for testing
      * a test double for dependent objects - like datasource
      * can provide expected response
      * can verify expected interactions
      
    * Spy    
      * like a mock, but a real object is used
      * mocks completely replace expected object
      * spys are wrappers, but with real objects inside
  
  * Junit Tests
    * Use Assertions
      * https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.0.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html
    * using junit 5
    * a test method will be annotated as @Test
      - @Test
        void getBar(){}    
    * when the junit test runner will know this is test method and will pick this class and run it  
    
  * Common Testing Frameworks (all used together)
    * Junit 4/5 by Jupiter
    * mockito
    * Spring MVC Test
      * used for testing controllers
      * provide mock servlet environment
    * Rest-assured
      * used for testing restful web services
      * can be used with spring mock mvc  
    * Selenium
      * Functional test, browser level
      
  * CI vs CD(continuous deployment) vs CD(continuous delivery)    
    * CI => running test immediately after commit
    * CD => deployment after test succeeds, build artifacts after CI tests run and deploy
    * CD(delivery) => process of automatically delivering changes directly to production 
  
  * Commands to run test
    * https://www.codejava.net/testing/junit-test-suite-example-how-to-create-and-run-test-suite-in-command-line-and-eclipse
    * https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/october/article5.php
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2235276/how-to-run-junit-test-cases-from-the-command-line
    * Commands
      - mvn clean test
      * Or you can run a particular test as below
     
      - mvn clean test -Dtest=your.package.TestClassName
      - mvn clean test -Dtest=your.package.TestClassName#particularMethod
      * If you would like to see the stack trace (if any) in the console instead of report files in the 
        target\surefire-reports folder, set the user property surefire.useFile to false. For example:
     
      - mvn clean test -Dtest=your.package.TestClassName -Dsurefire.useFile=false
  
  * Example's  
    * https://github.com/springframeworkguru/tdd-by-example 
    
    * Project setup for testing section 3, 15
      * Degenerate Objects
        * create new instance of class when testing
          - Dollar product = five.times(2);
            assertEquals(10, product.amount);
            product = five.times(3);
            assertEquals(15, product.amount);
    
      * Equality for All
        * checking if two objects are equal, by overriding Equals method
        - assertEquals(), assertNotEquals
        
  * Important tips
    * to display the object attributes, override toString method in the class. 
    
  * Section 4, Junit 5 setup
    * Major annotations in Junit
      * @Test => marks a method as a test method
      * @ParameterizedTest => marks the method as parameterized test
      * @RepeatedTest => Repeat test N times
      * @TestFactory => Test Factory method for dynamic tests
      * @TestInstance => used to configure test instance lifecycle  
      * @TestTemplate => creates a template to be used by multiple test cases
      * @DisplayName => Human friendly name for test
      * @BeforeEach => Method to run before each test
      * @AfterEach => Method to run after each testcase
      * @BeforeAll => Static method to run before all test cases in current class 
      * @AfterAll => Static method to run after all test cases in current class 
      * @Nested => Creates a nested test class
      * @Tag => declares tags for filtering tests
      * @Disabled => disable test or test class
      * @ExtendWith => used to register with extensions

          * Types of mocks
            * Dummy - object used just to get code to compile
            * Fake - An Object that has an implementation, but not production ready
            * Stub - An Object with pre-defined answers to method calls
            * Mock - An Object with pre-defined answers to method calls, and has expectations of executions. Can throw an
              exception if an unexpected invocation is detected
            * spy - in mockito spies are Mock like wrappers around the actual object  
          
          * Important Terminology
            * Verify - used to verify number of times a mocked method has been called
            * Argument Matcher - Matches a  rguments passed to Mocked Method & will allow or disallow
            * Argument Captor - captures arguments passed to a Mocked method
            
          * Annotations
            * @Mock => intialise a mock
            * @Spy

# Multi Threading - https://github.com/raj23manj/multithreading
  * Implements Runnable vs Extending thread class
    * When we extend Thread class, we can’t extend any other class even we require and When we implement Runnable, 
      we can save a space for our class to extend any other class in future or now.
      When we extend Thread class, each of our thread creates unique object and associate with it. 
      When we implements Runnable, it shares the same object to multiple threads.
  
  * Processes & Threads - section 2
    * Creating a process is costly, but a thread is cheap
    * A thread is light weight process, it is also a unit of execution in a process 
    * A process can have any number of threads, these threads the share the same resources (memory etc) as that of the process that created it.
    * Think a java microservices application, each application is a process that can create threads.
    * A thread is used to execute a block of code, threads can communicate with each other(IPC - inter process communication)
  
    * Benefits
    * do several things at the same time
    * improve performance
    * better utilization  
    
    * Disadvantages
    * threads manipulate data located on the same memory area -> need to synchronize 
    * hard to detect errors
    * expensive operations 
      * pass data between threads using callable and future
      * switching between threads cpu save local data, pointers of the current thread and loads the data of other thread 
    
    * Threads Life Cycle
    * stages 
      * new - when we instantiate a new thread it is in this state, until start() is called
      * runnable
      * running - threads stars executing it's tasks
      * waiting - when a thread is waiting for another thread to finish its task. When other thread signals, it starts executing again (wait() & sleep())
      * dead - after the thread finishes it's tasks    
      
  * Basic Multithreading - section 3
    * Sequential Processing - 6
    * 7 & 8 how to create threads
      * implement Runnable Interface
      * extends Thread Class
    * Join - 9
      * waits for this(current attached method) thread to die.
      * t1.join() -> if a t1 thread is running then calling this the main thread will wait until t1 is dead to continue execution
         *  Runner1 t1 = new Runner1();
            Runner2 t2 = new Runner2();
            
            t1.start();
            t2.start();
            
            try {
                t1.join();
                //t2.join();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            
            System.out.println("Finished the tasks..."); -> if we want this to be displayed at the end then use join(), if not it will print first only
        
    * Volatile - 10
      * There is a main memory "RAM"(HEAP), each thread1(cache(stack) + CPU1(thread)), thread2(cache(stack) + CPU2(thread)) are processors which have their own cache(stack) that keep
        local variables stored for better performance. Now if there is a variable that need's to be shared along with notifying its value changed
        between the threads we can use a Volatile variable, which will be stored on the "RAM". This variable will be shared between threads, when
        thread changes it's value other threads get notified of it's changes so that the value remains consistent between the threads.                 
      
      * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17748078/simplest-and-understandable-example-of-volatile-keyword-in-java
      
      * IMPORTANT
        * not only sharing between thread's, if a variable is present in a runnable thread, it stores in the cache associated with thread only.
          * class Worker implements Runnable {
          
          	private boolean isTerminated = false; // => making this volatile, private volatile boolean isTerminated; stores it in the Main memory
          	
          	public void run() {
          		
          		while(!isTerminated) {
          			
          			System.out.println("Hello from worker class...");
          			
          			try {
          				Thread.sleep(300);
          			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
          				e.printStackTrace();
          			}
          		}
          	}
          
          	public boolean isTerminated() {
          		return isTerminated;
          	}
          
          	public void setTerminated(boolean isTerminated) {
          		this.isTerminated = isTerminated;
          	}
          }

      * it's slower.
    
    * Deadlocks & Livelocks - 11     
      * Deadlocks is a situation in which two or more competing actions are each waiting for the other to finish, and thus neither does.
        * examples: 
          * Databases: deadlocks happens when two processes each within it's own transaction updates two rows of information but in the opposite order.
            For example, process A updates row 1 then row 2, in the same time frame Process B updates row 2 and then row 1
      
      * LiveLocks
        * A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread.
        * if the other thread's action is also a response to the action of the another thread, this is live lock.
        * LiveLocked threads are unable to make further progress. However, the threads are not blocked, they are simply too busy responding to each other
          to resume work.
        * Example:
          * like two people attempting to pass each other in a narrow corridor. A moves to his left to let B pass, but in response B moves to his right to let
            A pass. Hence blocking
            
    * Synchronized - 12
      * we should make sure the threads are going to wait for each other to finish the given task on the variables.
      * assume counter = 0, two threads accessing same counter, when thread one access it, it is 0 and increments it to 1, in the mean time when thread
        two access the counter it also still at 0 where as it should be 1 incremented, but in the time thread one set's the value to the counter, thread 2
        reads and goes and the cycle repeats, we get wrong outputs  
      * public static synchronized void increment() {
        		++counter;
        	}  
             
    * Synchronized Blocks(avoid class intrensic locks(lock on all methods which ha synchronised)) - 13
      * when using "synchronized" on the methods as show below, java add's an class intrensic lock to App class, which means when two threads are started at the
        same time, when thread 1 is accessing count1 then thread2 cannot access count2 variable because the "synchronized" is present on both hte methods and
        making thread 1 to complete and adding an "Intrensic lock", this makes performance slower, to avoid this, see below example   
      * public class App { // wait & notify refer here
        
        	private static int count1 = 0;
        	private static int count2 = 0;
        	
        	public synchronized static void add() {
        		count1++;
        	}
        	
        	public synchronized static void addAgain() {
        		count2++;
        	}
       }
       
      * Better approach
        public class App {
                
            private static int count1 = 0;
            private static int count2 = 0;
            
            private static Object lock1 = new Object();
            private static Object lock2 = new Object();
            
            public  static void add() {
               synchronized(lock1) {  //  synchronized(this) || synchronized(App.class) => this again makes java to apply internsic lock, hence a better solution create new Object and apply on them
                count1++;
               } 
            }
            
            public synchronized static void addAgain() {
            synchronized(lock2) {  // synchronized(App.class) 
                count2++;
               }
            }
       } 
       
    * Wait & Notify & NotifyAll- 14
      * wait() => wait for infinite time, so say wait(10000)
      * wait() can be called only in a synchronized block 
      * when the thread comes across wait(10000ms), it goes to wait until another thread comes, when it does come it hand's over the intrensic lock on the class
        to that thread so that it can take control and execute on the same object(Processor), once it is done it can notify other threads that it is done and other threads can take
        control again ang continue execution, that is waiting for the lock on the same object(Processor)
      * this scenario comes because if the all the methods are synchronized, then it is case of one thread has to wait while other thread completes fully,
        see above example. To avoid this we use the "better approach" or use wait() and notify(). When thread1 starts execution it acquires lock, then waits after
        thread2 starts see's synchronized methods and wait's but instead because of the wait() in thread1 it gets the lock by transferring and continues.
      * when using notify() and Thread.sleep(3000)(or any other code) together like below, the thread will not not immediatedly notify, it will wait until the end of the
        block is reached and then only notify
        -  { ....
           notify()
           Thread.sleep(3000) 
           }   
        
        *  here also since notify is in the loop, which means there is code following, it wont notify until it reaches wait()  
          - while(true) {
              if( list.size() == LIMIT ) {
                    					System.out.println("Waiting for removing items from the list...");
                    					lock.wait();
                    				} else {
                    					System.out.println("Adding: "+value);
                    					list.add(value);
                    					value++;
                    					lock.notify();
                    				}
                    				
                    				Thread.sleep(500);
        
          }

    * Locks & Synchronization - 18
      * A re-entrant lock has the same basic behaviour as we have seen for synchronized blocks, but with additional features
      * using re-entrant lock, we can make a lock fair, prevent thread starvation, Synchronized blocks are unfair by default
      * we can check whether the given lock is held or not using re-entrant lock     
      * we can get the list of threads waiting for the given lock with re-entrant locks
      * Synchronized blocks are nicer, we do not need the try-catch-finally block
      * lock.tryLock(time in ms, Unit) => used to try if lock can be aquired for given time, if not held by other threads
      
    * Semaphores - 19 & 20
      * semaphores are thread safe be default
      * Semaphores are variables or ADT(abstract data types) that are used for controlling access to a common resource 
      * important in OS
      * It has a record of how many units of a particular resource are available. It wait's until a unit of the resource becomes
        available
      * Types:
        * Counting Semaphores: allows an arbitrary resource count
        * Binary Semaphores: semaphore which are restricted to the values 0 and 1   
      
      * Semaphore are used in situations for example an library with study rooms, which has front desk. If there are 10 rooms, and students want
        to use it one. To prevent disputes students must request a room from the front desk. If no rooms are available then they have to wait until
        any of the rooms get free. When a student using room has finished, he must return to the front desk and indicate that a room is free.
        
        * Types:
          * Count Semaphore
          * Binary Semaphore
        
        * Scenario 2: 
           when downloading we can use semaphores, wait until all units are complete and then do task on it 
           
        * Scenario 3:
          resctrict the number of people downloading an imgae, like 1000 only to download using acquire() the permits   
        
      * Semaphore tracks only how many resources are free, it does not keep track of which of the resources are free
      * the semaphores count may serve as a useful trigger for a number of different actions
      * producer-consumer problem can be implemented with the help of semaphores efficiently  
      
      * Mutex
        * a mutex is essentially the same thing as a binary semaphore
        * while a binary semaphore may be used as a mutex, a mutex is a more specific use-case 
        * Mutexes have a concept of a owner. only the process that locked the mutex is suppose to unlock it.
        * mutexes may provide priority inversion safety. if the mutex knows its current owner, it is possible to promote the priority of the owner
          whenever a higher priority tasks starts waiting on the mutex
        * mutex can provide deletion safety   
        
        * semaphore maintains a set of permits
           	- acquire() -> if a permit is available then takes it
           	- release() -> adds a permit		
            * Semaphore just keeps a count of the number available
            * new Semaphore(int permits, boolean fair) !!!  fair => prevent thread starvation
            
        * enum Downloader { // singleton
          	
          	INSTANCE;  // thread safe

  * Concurrent Collections - section 4
    * CountDownLatch/Latches - 23
      * This is used to synchronize one or more tasks by forcing them to wait for the completion of a set of operations being performed by other tasks
        // * 		- You give an initial count to a CountDownLatch object, and any task that calls await()
        // * 				on that object will block until the count reaches zero
        // * 
        // * 		- Other tasks may call countDown() on the object to reduce the count, presumably when a task finishes its job
        // * 		- A CountDownLatch is designed to be used in a one-shot fashion; the count cannot be reset !!!
        // * 				If you need a version that resets the count, you can use a CyclicBarrier instead
        // * 
        // * 		- The tasks that call countDown() are not blocked when they make that call. Only the call to await() is blocked until the count reaches zero
        // * 
        // * 		A typical use is to divide a problem into n independently solvable tasks and create a CountDownLatch with a value of n.
        // * 		When each task is finished it calls countDown() on the latch. Tasks waiting for the problem to be solved call await() 
        // * 		on the latch to hold themselves back until it is completed

    * BLocking Queue - 25
         * BlockingQueue -> an interface that represents a queue that is thread safe
         * 		Put items or take items from it ...
         * 
         * 		For example: one thread putting items into the queue and another thread taking items from it
         * 			at the same time !!!
         * 				We can do it with producer-consumer pattern !!!
         * 
         * 		put() putting items to the queue
         * 		take() taking items from the queue    
         * class FirstWorker implements Runnable {

    * Delay Queue - 26
         * This is an unbounded BlockingQueue of objects that implement the Delayed
         * interface
         * 
         * - DelayQueue keeps the elements internally until a certain delay has expired
         * 
         * - an object can only be taken from the queue when its delay has expired !!! -
         * 
         * We cannot place null items in the queue - The queue is sorted so that the
         * object at the head has a delay that has expired for the longest time.
         * 
         * If no delay has expired, then there is no head element and poll( ) will
         * return null
         * 
         * size() return the count of both expired and unexpired items !!!    
            
    * Priority Queue - 27
         * BlockingQueue<String> queue = new PriorityBlockingQueue<>();
         * It implements the BlockingQueue interface
         * 
         * 	- unbounded concurrent queue
         * 	- it uses the same ordering rules as the java.util.PriorityQueue class -> have to implement the C0mparable interface
         * 			The comparable interface will determine what will the order in the queue
         * 
         * 			The priority can be the same compare() == 0 case
         * 
         *  - no null items !!!
         
    * Concurrent maps - 28
      * using a thread safe hashmap => private ConcurrentMap<String, Integer> map;
      * see the example      
      * other collections => Collections.synchronized* (map, set, list)
      
    * Exchanger - 29
         *  With the help of Exchanger -> two threads can exchange objects
         * 
         * exchange() -> exchanging objects is done via one of the two exchange()
         * methods
         * 
         * For example: genetic algorithms, training neural networks
         * using exchanger, one thread is going to add and other thread also should add, this is how exchanger works
         
  * Parallel Algorithms - Section 8
    * Types of Algorithms
      * Sequential - execute task one after the other
      * Parallel - execute different tasks with different processors and combine the results
      
    * Difference between concurrent and parallel
      * Parallel(multi core processor) - execute different tasks with different processors and combine the results
      * Concurrent(single processor) - it makes time sharing between the threads which is slower than simple sequential 
        implementation, one thread at a given time
    
    * Disadvantages   
      * inter communication between threads slows down the while merging the results. In-case of small data sets this will fails
        if larger data sets it will be faster. Example: merge sort
      * Load Balance: we have to make sure that we split the work evenly amongst the processors.
        example: to find prime numbers from 0-1000, if we split for 2 threads a subset of 0 - 500 and 501 - 1000, the thread1 might finish
        before thread2 and wait, wasting the computation time.
    
  * Fork-Join Framework - section 9
    * concrete implementation for parallel execution       
    * this framework helps to make an algorithm parallel
    * Divide and conquer algorithms
    * we do not have to bother about low level synchronizations or locks
    * A larger task -> it can be divided into smaller ones + the subsolutions can be combined
    * important subtasks have to be independent in order to be executed in parallel
    * so the main concept -> fork-join framework breaks the tasks into smaller subtasks until these suntasks are simple enough to solve without further 
      breakups
    * methods used in this framework
      * fork(): Asynchrounously execute the given task in the pool. We can call this on RecursiveAction or RecursiveTask<T>
      * join(): returns the result of the computation when it's done, and waits for the task to be done
      * invoke(): execute the given task + return its result upon completion 
      * invokeAll(leftSubtask, rightSubtask); forks the tasks and puts it in the fork pool
  
  * MapReduce - section 10
    * we can make the given algorithm parallel
      * map: splits the original dataset
      * shuffel&sort: all th data is re-arranged for the next step to run in parallel. It makes sure that items with the 
        same keys will get to the same reducer   
      * combines the final results   
      
# Executor Service's In Depth:
  * Difference between the implement Runnable and extends Thread     
    * when we extend start() method is a part of the class itself, so when we instantiate we the class we get start() method.
    * when we implement Runnable, it is just an interface, and need to implement run() method in the implementing class, to get the start() method
      we need to pass the Runnable implementing class to  the Thread class as a constructor.
      - new Thread(myclass).start
      
  * Executor Service:
    * Uses internal thread pools, for each executor service created
    * shutdown(), shutdownNow()    
    * Fixed Thread Pool:
      * where we pass the number of threads that needs to be used to execute the task,  if new tasks are added apart from "n" tasks, then they have to wait
        unit threads are free
      * Only limited threads can be created  
    * Cached Thread Pool:
      * if threads in the thread pool are all busy, then a new thread will be created for the new task to execute, it the busy thread is free then it will be reused.
      * there is no limit in thread creation, any number can be there
    * Single Thread Executor:
      * Thread Pool Size is one
    * it has two methods execute() (used to execute runnable implementation), and submit() (used to execute runnable & callable implementation's)  
    * submit(), gives a future in return to call additional methods like get(), cancel(true) 
      
  * Naming Threads:
    * using Thread.currentThreadName().getName();    
    * when creating a thread
      * new Thread(new LoopTask(), "MyThread");
      * Thread t2 = new Thread(new LoopTask());
      *    t2.setName("My Thread");
      
    * Executor Service - section3-17
      * Need to implement ThreadFactory 
      * ex: 
          public class NamedThreadFactory implement ThreadFactory {
            private static int cnt = 0;
            private static String Name = "MyThread-";
            
            @Override
            public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
              Thread t = new Thread(r, Name + ++count);
              return t;
            }
          }
          
          in main class :
            ExecutorService execService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(new NamedThreadFactory());
            execService.execute(new LoopTask());
             execService.execute(new LoopTask());
             
             o/p: [MyTHread-1] ----
                  [MyTHread-2] ----
            
    * Returning Values:
      * Blocking :
        * using synchronised blocks with wait() and notifyAll(), along with getter method
      * Non - Blocking:
        * Using CallBack and observer
        * implementing ResultListener<T>  our own, and passing the object of the class of that to the thread and make it display value     
      
      * From Executor Services:
        * 1st way
          * implementing a callable interface
          * use submit() method on executor method 
          * the o/p will be in the order they are submitted, even if later task finished it needs to wait for the current one to complete
        
        * 2nd way
          * the o/p will be in the order they are completed, even if later task finished it needs not wait for the current one to complete
          * take() blocks until the given task completes, and poll() it is asynchronous it keeps polling and see's if any task completes.
          * using completion service    
             ExecutorService execService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(new NamedThreadsFactory());
             CompletionService<Integer> tasks = new ExecutorCompletionService<Integer>(execService);
             
             tasks.submit(new CalculationTaskA(2,3,2000));
             tasks.submit(new CalculationTaskA(3,4,1000));
             
             tasks.submit(new newLoopTaskA(), 99);
             
             // take() it will wait until the next task is completed and then execute, if already present will proceed
             
             for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
                System.out.println("Result = " + tasks.take().get());
             }
             
        * 3rd way 
          * after calling join() method call the setter or variable to get the result     
    
    * Creating Dameon Threads
      * Dameon threads are background and/or service providing threads
      * they are killed by JVM as soon as no user thread is running any longer, for daemon thread to be alive atleast one user thread needs to be alive 
      * can be stopped normally too like normal threads            
      * main thread is a user thread         
      * Dameon threads can be running in background without interacting with any other threads
      * Dameon threads can end before the user thread also finishes
      * Creation of Dameon Threads
        *  Thread t = new Thread(new LoopTask(), "Demo");
           t.setDaemon(true);
           
    * Creating Dameon Threads Using Executor Service:
      * similar to setting like normal thread like above  
             
    * Check if Threads are Alive
      * t1.isAlive();
      
      * In Executor Service:
        * is used to check if a task is done, using Future.isDone(); 
        * There is FutureTaskClass
          * FutureTask<?> ft3 = new FutureTask<Void> (new LoopTaskC(), null);
          
    * Terminate Threads
      * when task is done then thread ends or dies for normal threads but for executor's it is different as threads are cached after finishing tasks   
      * need to implement a new method to be called to stop, when implementing runnable or callable, internally it uses a shutdown flag that it keeps checking constantly
      * 1st way Terminating normal threads (non blocking) - private volatile boolean shutdown = false;
      
         public void cancel(){
           System.ot.println('shut down');
           
           synchronized(this){
                this.shutdown=true;
           }
         }   
         
         public void run() {
           .....
           
           synchronised(this){
            if(shutdown){
                break;
            }
           }
         }  
      
      * 2nd way - Terminating normal threads(non blocking)
        * using interrupt method
          * void Thread.interrupt() - usually called by another thread on the thread to be interrupted (from main user thread to interrupt the threads)
          * static boolean Thread.interrupted() - to be called from inside the interrupted Thread (inside run() method)
          * boolean Thread.isInterrupted() - to be called by another thread on the interrupted thread
          * use break; statement to come out of the task if being interrupted
      
      * Terminating Normal Threads - Blocked Threads(sleeping)
        * making the thread to sleep using sleep()
        * then use interrupt() and interrupted() methods like above
        * use break; statement to come out of the task if being interrupted
        
        * Recieve an interrupt at a blocking point and exit at a non-blocking point:
          * we can set a boolean variable once when interrupted along with Thread.interrupted() and use it later in the code to exit.
          * here once after setting the boolean flag after Thread.interrupt() is called, Thread.interrupted() will be true          
      
      * Terminating tasks that are run by executors
        * Non-Blocking
          * similar to setting a boolean flag and using it later with synchronised blocks
          * need to implement a callable instead of runnable
        
        * Blocked   
          * implementing callable
          * using Future.cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning) - to be called by the class holding the Future ref. (from main thread)
          * static boolean Thread.interrupted() - to be called from inside the interrupted task
          * boolean Future.isCancelled() - to be called on the future outside the interrupted task (from main thread)
      
      * Terminating all executor tasks in one shot
        * shutdownNow()
          * uses interrupt under the hood
          * returns a list of tasks that were awaiting execution yet
          * to await termination after shutting down,
            * boolean ExecService.awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
          * cancellation exception and interrupted exception  
            * cancellation exeception: happens when cancel is called on future
            * Interrupted exeception: happens when future.get() is called by current thread and waiting and is interrupted
            
    * Uncaught Exceptions:
      * leaking exceptions from thread cannot be caught directly   
      * we need to implement Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler interface  
      * need to implement void uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable e)   
      
      * 1st way to handle uncaught exceptions: (default handler)
        * set a default handler for all the threads in the system
        * only one instance for all the threads
        * done using static void Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(UncaughtExceptionHandler eh)
        * Need to create a class implementing UncaughtExceptionHandler interface
        * Inform JVM to use this class by,
          * Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(new MycustomExceptionDefaultHandler())
      
      * 2nd way to handle uncaught exceptions: (having multiple handlers for each thread)
        * need to use void Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler(UncaughtExceptionHandler eh) => this is an instance method
        
          Thread t = new Thread(new ExceptionLeakingTask(), "MyThread-1");
          t.setUncaughtExceptionHandler(new MycustomExceptionDefaultHandler());
      
      * 3rd way to handle uncaught exceptions: defaults and overrides
        * Using Both default and override specific one
      
      * Handling Exceptions in Executors
        * Need to create a class implementing UncaughtExceptionHandler interface  
        * 1st way:
          * use like normal thread 
            * Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(new MycustomExceptionDefaultHandler())
              ExecutorService execService1 = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(); 
              execService1.execute(new MyTask())
        
        * 2nd way:
          * Specific Handlers for different threads
            * like creating a daemon thread and setting name for the threads implementing ThreadFactory class, we need to set 
              custom handlers there using Thread's method
              Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(UncaughtExceptionHandler eh)
              
            * in constructor we can set
              * Thread t = super.newThread(r)
                t.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(new ThreadExceptionHandler());  
                
            * in the main class;
               ThreadExceptionHandler => implements ThreadFactory class 
               ExecutorService execService1 = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(new ThreadExceptionHandler());     
                
            * Using Both methods default and override       
            
    * Waiting For Threads to Finish
      * Joining other threads using Normal Threads-Api      
        using join() method   
        
      * Returning Value's from Tasks  
        * after calling join() method call the setter or variable to get the result
        
      * Joining Executor Services
        * count down latch
        * cyclic barrier  
        
  * Scheduling Tasks    
    * java.util.Timer
      * For One Time Execution
        * void schedule(TimerTask task, Date d)  
        * void schedule(TimerTask task, long delay)
      * For Multiple time executions fixed delay 
        * void schedule(TimerTask task, Date d, long period)
        * void schedule(TimerTask task, long d, long period)
      * For Multiple time executions fixed rate   
        * void scheduleAtFixedRate(TimerTask task, Date date,  long period)
        * void scheduleAtFixedRate(TimerTask task, long delay,  long period)
      * void cancel()
      * TimerTask is the task that needs to be executed in future
      * we set date when to be executed or time in ms delay to be executed from current time
      
      * important points:
        * Single task-execution-thread per Timer Object
        * Timer tasks should complete quickly
        * Always call Timer.cancel(), when application is shutting down, otherwise it will cause memory leaks
          especially when using dameon threads
        * don't schedule more taks on Timer after cancelling it   
        * Timer is thread safe
      
    * java.util.TimerTask  
      * create a task implementing java.util.TimerTask which inturn implements runnable
      * make sure tasks execution are short lived
      * void scheduledExecutionTime() => return the time it takes for execution of task
      * boolean cancel()
      
    * One Time Execution  
      * instead of implementing runnable, implement java.util.TimerTask 
      * Run the Timer thread as a Dameon thread and not a normal user thread, coz it might take a long time to terminate and make the program hang

# Algorithm Analysis
  * Complexity  
    * Space : how much memory an algorithm needs
    * Time : how much time an algorithm needs, this is more widely concentrated as memory is cheap now a days.
      * we consider number of steps, it is generic, machine independent
      * we need algorithms where the running times are linear or sub-linear
      
      * Linear example: O(N)
        sorting 10 items: 1ms  , as i/p increases, time taken also is double the first iteration
        sorting 20 items: 2ms
        sorting 100 items: 10ms
        
        O(N^2) Quadratic time complexity:
        sorting 10 items: 1ms  , as i/p increases, time taken also increases n^2 to the first one
        sorting 20 items: 4ms
        sorting 100 items: 100ms
    
    * Big O  => basically loops in programming   
    * Big Omega
    * Big Theta
    
    * Algorithms running Time - section 8(listing time in best order top to bottom)
      * O(1) => constant time complexity and best
        * example: number is even or odd, swap two elements
      * O(logN) => logarithmic complexity
        * Discarding half array in every iteration
        * finding an arbitrary item in a sorted array(binary search)
        * check whether there is a  cycle in a graph
      * O(N) => linear time complexity
        * finding the max or min value in the array of numbers
      * O(N*logN) => linearithmic complexity , this is the threshold beyond this is bad
        * merge sort, quicksort, heapsort.
        * finding closest pair of points with divide and conquer method
      * O(n^k) , k > 1 polinomial
        * bubble sort, insertion sort, where k =2, quadratic
      * O(c^n), exponential, c is a constant
        * tower of hanoi, calculating numbers with recursive manner, travelling salesman problem
      * O(n!) factorial complexity, and worst 
        *

# Java Memory Management (https://www.udemy.com/java-memory-management/learn/lecture/6057442#overview)
  * JVM memory is split into to stack and heap  (Section 2)
    - stack memory is associated with the threads each created
      - all local variables and primitive types are stored here in the stack
    - heap memory is a huge memory and is used as common memory to be shared between threads
      - all the objects which are big are stored in the heap and a reference variable is stored in the stack 
      
    - example:
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> myList = new ArrayList<String>();
        myList.add("one"); //==> myList.add(new String("one"))
        
        printList(myList);
      } 
      
      public static void printList(List<String> data) {
        String value = data.get(0);
        data.add("Four"); //==> data.add(new String("two"))
        System.out.println(data)
      }
      
      stack:                                        Heap:
      
         value   ------------------------------------------------------------       
                                                                            |
                                                                            v        
         data    ------------------------------>  |
         mylist=<ref-addr>   ----------->         | List(with data)   ---> String(one)  
         
  * Passing Valuesand Reference
    - public static void main(String[] args) {
      Customer c = new Customer("Sally");
      renameCustomer(c);
      System.out.println(c.getName()); 
    }                            
    
    public static void renameCustomer(Customer cust) {
    cust.setName("Diane");
    }
    
    - Here, 
    
       Stack:                                       Heap:
       
          #cust.setName("Diane")#
          
         cust ------------------------------------> | Customer(name) -------> String(diane) 
         c ---------------------------------------> | Customer(name) X String(sally) # this is set for garbage collection
       
         cust ------------------------------------> |
         c ---------------------------------------> | Customer(name) -------> String(sally)
    
    
    - final keyword
       like making a constant
       
  * Escaping references: (section 4)
    
    * Note: when objects are immutable, assiging creates a new object of that type in the heap
  
    * by passing a copy of the objects
    * by using a iterator
    * using collections.unmodifyablemap => best solutions   
    
    * all primitive types and string are immutable, hence returning them is no a problem
    * when a class has a setter it is not immutable abd returning the object reference is escaping, hence create
      a read only interface and and make the class implement it and pass the type as that of the interface  
      
  * String Pools 
    * only for string objects, when java creates a string object it places it in the string pool, so
     String a = "hello";
     String b = "hello";  
     
     when checking their equality with (==) , it will be a and b both referencing to same objects, but below case
     it wont, java will place it it in different pools
     
     String c = new Integer(76).toString();
     String d = "76";   
     
     To make it place in the same pool as string need to use intern() method
     
     String c = new Integer(76).toString().intern();
     String d = "76";  
     
  * Garbage collection:
    * memory leak : objects that are not freed continue to consume memory. Need to do a restart of th machines if 
      it happens
    * Java handles it by
      * Running a virtual machine which is a program tha runs on the OS memory and handles the memory allocation
        and freeing up memory
      * Adopts Garbage Collection Strategy 
    * Java Rule for garbage collection: (runs automatically)
      Any object on the heap which cannot be reached by a reference from the stack is eligible for GC  
      * SYstem.gc(); method available to free memory
      * finalize() method will be called by GC, when added in the class
      
  * Detecting Soft Leaks:
    *  when using multiple threads this will occur   
  
  * Mark and Sweep:
    * Uses mark and sweep algorithm to mark all the alive objects, by traversing through the stack and making 
      references of the variable's and it's references in the heap as alive. This is done through out the stack. When
      this process starts it stops all the process, this is called stop the world event
    * Once all are marked alive, the rest of the objects are destroyed, and the jvm allocates the live objects into
      a contigueous memory and frees up fragments of memory so that allocation in future is easier.    
           
  * Generational Garbage Collection:
    * Since the mark and sweep algo needs all the programs to be stopped which is not ideal, the jvm follows 
      generational garbage collection.
    * In this method the heap memory is divided into young generation and old generation heap memory. Any new objects created will be created
      in the young generation, it's memory is less compared to old and gc runs to free the memory only when the yong generation is full, 
      the live one's are then moved to the old heap memory. The GC on the young generation is very fast takes a fraction of a second and the application does not freeze.
      Once a object survives once GC on yong generation, it is likely to live forever. All the surviveing objects are then copied to old generation, then the young generation
      is empty and any new objects can be added to this young generation. GC of young generation is known as 'minor collection' 
    * The GC will run even on the old generation only if it's needed i.e when its full, this is called 'major collection' and will be much slower and 
      compaction processes(moving into contigeuous memory) will take some seconds and will be slow
    * The young generation is divided into eden, s0 and s1 in the memory, instead of the live objects being directly into the old generation, during the
      GC, it is first moved into s0 and then to s1. It is moved only to old generation if it survives gc on the young generation 8 times.       
    * PermGen/MetaSpace:
      * there is a seperate memory present for storing the meta data of a class when it is created and it is stored int the metaspace(in java 8). During re-delopyment of the
        code this meta space is cleared everytime. This memory space is outside the jvm it is associated with the OS memory directly   
  
  
  * Tuning the virtual machine:
    * Command line args to set the limit
      * Heap Size
        * -Xmx   - set max heap size   
        * -Xms   - set starting heap size  
        * -XX:maxPermSize  - set permsize(in java 6)
        * -Xmn  - set size of the young generation
        
  * Types Of GC
    * single - uses single thread for small amounts of data single process
    * parallel - used for young generation(minor collections), running multiple threads in parallel, used for larger data sets better than concurrent
    * concurrent - closes to get to real time GC, it pauses the app to do marking of objects and the sweeps     
    
  * Strong , Weak and soft References
    * the type of reference from the stack to heap can any of the type 
    * weak reference:
      is the weakest and will be likely available for GC, after GC variable will be set to null
    * soft :
      JVM will decide if the there is no space then only will this type of reference to GC, after GC variable will be set to null
    * weak and soft are mostly used for caching  
    * Ways to do in java   
      - WeakReference<Book> myBook = book1;
      - SoftReference<Book> myBook = book2;    
      
        if(myBook==null){
            reload object from source
        }

        * Cloneable interface => not recommended
        * Using copy Constructor
        * Copy Through Serialization, implementing Serializable
      * Singleton
        * make the constructor private

        * Static Decorator:
           * using generics   
        * Adapter Decorator
          * using both adapter and decorator

        * A chain of components who all get a chance to process a command or a query, optionally having default processing implementation 
          and an ability to terminate the processing chain  
        * Method Chain  
          * number, being negative  posivite 
      * Command
        * an object which represents an instructions to perform a particular action. Contains all the information necessary for the action to
          be taken
        * bank account deposit and withdraw  
      * Interpreter 
        * macmt rules example
        * lexer(split string) and parser(convert to objects and do calculation)
        * Antlr
      * Iterator
        * traverse data structures
        * java has Iterator<T>, Iterable<T>
      * Mediator 
        * a component that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarily being aware of each other
          or having direct access to each other
        * chat room, or online gaming, where each person are connected to a central(mediator)   
      * Memento
        * a token/handle representing the system state. Lets us roll back to the state whe the token was generated. May or may not 
          directly expose state information.
        * example a bank with balance. The momento object will have balance set to it as a state and passed. If rollback the use this
          state  
      * Null object
      * Observer
      * State
      * Strategy 
      * Template
      * Visitor
      
  
  * SOLID
    * SRP -> only single responsibility
    * OSP -> methods or classes should not modify, only extension and no modification    
    * LSP -> substition of child to base should work -> this can be achieved using Factory pattern or seggregating each classes with SRP, 
      * vechile -> with engine -> car
                -> without engine -> cycle
    * ISP -> how to split interfaces into smaller interfaces (YAGNI principle => you ain't gonna need it)  using decorator pattern  
    * DIP -> (dependency inversion)     
      * High level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstraction
        => High level - means business logics, just need what i want dont care how it comes
           Low level - access to data storage implementations(arrays, lists)  and SRP classes
           
           means that a highlevel(business logic) should not directly depend on a low-level(data storage/concrete class), depend on abstraction instead
      * Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.  
        => means use interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes

* Apache Maven(GURU):
  * CLI compiling java 
    * *.jar, *.war, *.ear, *.Fatjars, docker containers     
    * we can unzip jar files
    * javac xxx.java => creates a compiled class file(bytecode)
      * Compile with 3rd party libraries
       * javac -classpath ./lib/* HelloWorld
    * java xxx => to run  
    * create a jar file
      * jar cf name.jar xxx.class
      * to run jar file need to add it to classpath
        * java -classpath name.jar <Class tot run>
        * to run 3rd party libraires
          * java -classpath ./lib/*:./ HelloWorld
  
  * Maven Basics:
    * maven corodinates:
      * used to identify artifacts
      * groupid => unique to org(use domain name, but reverse)
      * artifactid => project name
      * version => specifies version 
        * ex: 3.2.1-987-beta
          * major.minor.incremental(3.2.1)
          * Build number - 987 from ci build
          * Qualifier - 'beta' - string qualifier
        * ex: 3.2.1-SNAPSHOT
          * this implies as development version
          * not stable, shoild check for newer versions
          * maven will first check locally then remote repos
          * by default maven will check remote repos once per day (option is configurable) 
      
      * groupid & artifactId can be inherited from parent POM 
      
    * maven repositories:
      * local => under <use home>/.m2/
      * central => public hosted by maven community (maven.org)
      * remote - other locations which can be public or private (github, nexus)        
    
    * maven-wagon
      * it is a unified maven api
      * it is a transportation abstraction for artifact and repository handling code
      * allows different providers to communicate with maven repositories, uses HTTP/HTTPS
      * some time may need to configure Wagon for proxy settings 
    
    * Maven Project Object Model
      * POM, is the pom.xml that describes a maven project
      * must comply with maven-4.0.0..xsd
      * can inherit properties from parent POM
      * sub modules can also inherit
      * 'effective pom' is the pom complete with inherited properties
        * mvn help:effective-pom   
        
    * Maven-dependencies
      * dependency - it is an artifact which your maven project depends upon, a jar or pom
      * transitive dependency - a dependency of an artifact which your project depends on.
        * can go many layers deep
        * cyclic dependencies are not supported
      * Dependency Management - allow project authors to specifiy the versions of artifacts to be used   
      * Dependency Mediation - Determines what version to use when multiple versions of the same dependecny are encountered
        * 'Nearest Definition' in dependency tree is used
        * example: A -> B, A -> D 2.0, B -> D 1.5, then D version 2.0 would be included
      * Excluded Dependencies - Ability to exclude specific dependency
      * Optional Dependencies - Ability to make dependencies optional(exclude by default for downstream projects)    
      * Dependency Scope:
        * compile: default, available on the classpaths of the projects. Also propogated to downstream projects
        * Provided: Like compile, but expected to be provided by JDK or Container at runtime
        * Runtime: Not required for compile, but needed for runtime. On Runtime and test classpaths, not compile (JDBC Connection)
        * Test: Only available on the test classpath, not transitive
        * System: similar to provide, but JAR is added to system explicitly(via file path)
        * Import: imports dependency of POM
      * Maven Dependency Plugin:
        * dependencies are managed by this
        * important goals:
          * dependency:tree - shows the dependency tree, useful for resolving conflicts
          * dependency:go-offline: resolve all-all prepare to go offline
          * dependency:purge-local-repository - clear artifacts from local repo
          * dependency:sources - get sources for all dependencies 
      * Maven standard directory layout:
        *  projects structure
      * Maven Build Cycles:
        * a lifecyle is a pre-defined group of build steps called phases
        * each phase can be bound to one or more plugin goals  
        * maven has 3 pre defined lifecycles: clean, default, site
          * clean: does a clean of the project, removes all build artifacts from working directory (delets target directory)
            * defined with plugin bindings
            * preclean =? clean => post clean
          * default: does build and deployment of the project (testing, it testing packaging and deploy it target is mentioned)
            * defined without plugin bindings   
            * default life cycle high-level
              * validate - verify project is correct
              * compile - compile source code
              * Test - test compiled source code
              * package - package compiled files to packaging type
              * verify - run integration tests
              * install - install to local maven repository
              * deploy - deploy to shared maven repository
          * site: creates a website for your project, least used. like clean lifecycle
            * defined with plugin bindings
            * maven websites are all built using this site lifecycle   
            * Lifecycles:
              * Pre-site
              * Site - site
              * Post-site
              * Site-deploy  - deploy
      * Maven Wrapper:
        * https://www.baeldung.com/maven-wrapper
        * The Maven Wrapper is an excellent choice for projects that need a specific version of Maven
        * mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper   (default version specified in the packages taken) 
        * mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper -Dmaven=3.6.0   
      
      * Maven ArcheTypes:
        *  It is a project template    
        
      * Maven Plugins:
        * Maven Lifecycle Plugins:
            * Maven Clean Plugin : default lifecycle
              * Clean - has 'clean' goal
              * example:
               <build>
                 <plugins>
                   <plugin>
                     <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                     <artifactId>maven-clean-plugin</<artifactId>
                     <!--<version>x.x.x</version>-->
                     <executions>
                       <id>auto-clean</id>
                       <phase>initialize</phase>
                       <goals>
                         <goal>clean</goal>
                       </<goals>
                     </executions>
                   </plugin>
                 </<plugins>
               </build>
                 
            * Maven Compiler Plugins : default lifecycle 
              * compiler:compile, compiler:testCompile
              * example:
                
            * Maven Resources plugin : default lifecycle 
              * resources:resources, resources:testResources, resources:copy-resources  
              
            * Maven Surefire Plugin : default lifecycle
              * surefire:test => executing UT of project from test directory
              
            * Maven Jar Plugin : default lifecycle
              * jar:jar, jar:test-jar
              * to build jars from compiled artifacts and project resources 
               
            * Maven deploy plugin
              * deploy:deploy, deploy:deploy-file
              * to deploy artifacts to maven repos     
              * configuration part of maven POM
              
            * Maven Site Plugin
              * site:site, site:deploy, site:run, site:stage, site:stage-deploy, site:attach-descriptor, site:jar, site:effective-site
                
            * Maven and Source Control:
              * gitignore
            
            * other plugins  
            * cheat sheets
      
      * Generating Source with maven:
        * from XSD schema -> using jaxb plugin
        * from json schema -> jasonschema2pojo  
      
      * MapStruct
    
    * Testing with maven:
      * Unit Testing - completed by Maven Surefire Plugin
      * Integration Testing - completed by maven Failsafe Plugin (heavy weight tests)
      * Jacoco     
      * Spot bugs maven plugin
    
    * Multi Module Projects:
      * nested pom
      * parent pom  
      * maven reactor is what builds each module of the maven project
        * build order
          * project dependencies
          * plugin declaration
          * order of modules declared in the modules section in POM
          * each multi module creates a transitive dependency
      * Maven Flatten and Enforcer Plugin  
      * BOM (bill of material)
        * following DRY 
    
    * Build Profiles:
      * Per Project: 
        * defined in pom.xml
        * cli -> mvn package -S <path to setting file> 
      
      * Per User:
        * <user home>/.m2/settings.xml
      
      * Global:
        * <Maven Home>/conf/settings.xml    
        
    * Release Plugin:
      * used to release versions of projects    
    
    * BOM(common dependencies between microservices)
      * POM Difference from BOM 
        * it provides a curated set od dependencies, also common set of properties inherited
        * Does not set common plugins, common dependencies and common plugin configuration    
        
      * BOM Configuration
        * set common maven properties, maven plugin and configurations, versions, dependencies, build profiles, any inheritable
          property which is common       
      
      * BOM Creation:
        * <packaging>pom</packaging>, represents it's a BOM  
        * dependencyManagement => used when inheriting in parent pom for specific version(keep standard)
